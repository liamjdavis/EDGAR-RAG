Chief Executive Officer statement

“We are focused on driving high-quality sales growth and gross margin expansion, led by our Power Brands. Over the first half, we made progress on those ambitions.
Underlying sales grew 4.1%, driven by a third consecutive quarter of positive, improving volume growth, while pricing continued to moderate in line with our expectations. Strong gross margin progression fuelled increased investment behind our innovations, and resulted in a step-up of our profitability.
We continue to embed the Growth Action Plan, doing fewer things, better and with greater impact. The implementation of a comprehensive productivity programme and the separation of Ice Cream are key to delivering on that commitment and we are progressing at pace.
There is much to do, but we remain focused on transforming Unilever into a consistently higher performing business.”

|  1 | Outlook |

We continue to expect underlying sales growth (USG) for 2024 to be within our multi-year range of 3% to 5%, with the majority of the growth being driven by volume.
Underlying operating margin for the full year is expected to be at least 18%, with increasing investment behind our brands. We expect the year-on-year margin progression in the second half to be smaller than in the first half. 
Our very strong gross margin progression in the first half reflects positive contributions from volume leverage, mix and net productivity but also factors that will not repeat in the second half such as, a low prior year comparator affected by high input costs, and carry-over pricing from a period of higher inflation.

|  1 | (unaudited)    | Turnover | USG  | UVG  | UPG  | A&D    | Currency | Turnover change |
|  2 | First Half     | €31.1bn  | 4.1% | 2.6% | 1.6% | (0.7)% | (1.1)%   | 2.3%            |
|  3 | Second Quarter | €16.1bn  | 3.9% | 2.9% | 1.0% | (0.6)% | (1.0)%   | 2.2%            |

Underlying sales growth in the first half was 4.1%, led by volume of 2.6% and price of 1.6%. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of positive, improving volume growth, with UVG up 2.9% in Q2, increasing from 2.2% in Q1 and 1.8% in Q4 2023. Four of our five business groups delivered positive volume growth in Q2. As expected, underlying price growth continued to moderate from 2.8% in Q4 2023 to 1.0% in Q2.
The Power Brands performed strongly with 5.7% underlying sales growth, driven by volume growth of 4.0% in H1. Our other brands also saw a sequential volume improvement to (1.1)% in Q2, up from (2.0)% in Q1.
As expected, our turnover-weighted market share movement*, which measures our competitive performance within the footprint in which we operate, remained largely unchanged on a rolling 12 month-basis. We expect a sequential improvement of the share trend over time reflecting increasing benefit from the Growth Action Plan.
Beauty & Wellbeing grew underlying sales by 7.1%, with volume growth of 5.5% driven by continued double-digit growth from Health & Wellbeing and Prestige Beauty combined. In Q2, particularly strong growth in Health & Wellbeing more than offset softer growth in Prestige that reflected a slowdown in the US beauty market. Personal Care grew 5.6% with 2.9% from volume, led by continued strong sales growth of Deodorants. Home Care underlying sales increased 3.3%, with 4.6% volume growth more than offsetting the negative price growth linked to commodity cost deflation in some emerging markets. Nutrition grew underlying sales by 3.2%, driven by price with flat volume for the first half. Nutrition returned to positive volumes in Q2 at 0.4%, up from (0.4)% in Q1. Ice Cream continued to focus on operational improvements. Underlying sales growth was 0.6% with volume down (1.0)%, driven by weak sales in China and a softer start to the summer season in Europe.
Emerging markets (59% of Group turnover) grew underlying sales 5.1%, with 3.8% from volume and 1.3% from price. India grew 1.2%, with stronger volumes partially offset by price. Lower input costs led to negative price, while volumes in India sequentially improved throughout the first half, reaching 3.8% in Q2. Latin America grew 8.8%, with continued strong volume growth across the region. Africa and Turkey delivered broad-based, double-digit growth, driven by strong volume and price. Growth in South East Asia was adversely impacted by a sales decline of (5.7)% in Indonesia, where some consumers avoided the brands of multi-national companies in response to the geopolitical situation in the Middle East. China declined mid single-digit, due to market weakness across all categories apart from food service.
Developed markets (41% of Group turnover) grew underlying sales 2.8% with 0.8% from volume and 2.0% from price. The return to positive volume growth reflected a continued resilient performance in North America and a marked volume improvement in Europe, up 2.2% in Q2. As expected, price growth continued to moderate from the peak in Q2 2023.
Turnover was €31.1 billion, up 2.3% versus the prior year, including (1.1)% from currency and (0.7)% from disposals net of acquisitions.

Underlying operating profit was €6.1 billion, up 17.1% versus the prior year. Underlying operating margin increased 250bps to 19.6%. 
We improved gross margin by 420bps to 45.7%. Accelerating gross margin is a key focus for the business. We started to rebuild gross margin in the second half of 2023, with an improvement of 330bps and continued that momentum into the first half of 2024. The first half improvement reflects positive contributions from volume leverage, mix and net productivity but also factors that will not repeat in the second half such as, a low prior year comparator affected by high input costs, and carry-over pricing from a period of higher inflation. Improved gross margin supported a further step-up in brand and marketing investment behind a strong and focused innovation programme. Investment was up 180bps to 15.1% of turnover, an increase of €0.7 billion. Overheads reduced by 10bps, benefiting from a focus on tighter cost control.
Operating profit of €5.9 billion increased 7.8% against a prior year comparator that was boosted by higher profit on disposal.

Progress on productivity programme and Ice Cream separation

In March, we announced the separation of Ice Cream and the launch of a major productivity programme to strengthen the company and substantially improve our efficiency and effectiveness. Separation activity is underway and on track to complete by the end of 2025. We are working at pace on the legal entity set up, the standalone operating model and carve-out financials. In July, we communicated internally on the planned changes to simplify our business and further evolve our category-focused operating model. We have started consultations with the respective works councils.
Capital allocation
In February 2024, we announced a share buyback programme of up to €1.5 billion to be conducted during 2024. The first tranche of up to €850 million commenced in May.
As a result of the strong first half performance, the Board increased the quarterly interim dividend for Q2 by 3.0% to €0.4396, the first increase since Q4 2020.
We continued to reshape our portfolio, acquiring K18, a premium biotech hair care brand, in February, and completing the disposal of Elida Beauty in June. In July we announced agreements to sell our water purification businesses Pureit, to A.O. Smith, and stake in Qinyuan Group, to Yong Chao Venture Capital Co., Ltd. The deals are expected to complete in the second half of the year.

Beauty & Wellbeing (21% of Group turnover)

In Beauty & Wellbeing, we focus on three key priorities that will drive the unmissable superiority of our brands: elevating our core Hair Care and Skin Care brands to increase premiumisation; fuelling the growth of Prestige Beauty and Health & Wellbeing with selective international expansion; and continuing to strengthen our beauty and wellbeing capabilities.

|    |                |          |      |      |      |        |          |                 |       |               |

|  3 | Second Quarter | €3.4bn   | 6.8% | 5.4% | 1.3% | 0.2%   | (0.6)%   | 6.3%            |       |               |

Beauty & Wellbeing delivered another strong performance, with underlying sales up 7.1%, driven by volume up 5.5% and price up 1.5%. Power Brands led this growth with underlying sales growth of 11.3%.
Hair Care delivered mid-single digit growth with positive volume and price. Our largest hair care brand, Sunsilk grew double-digit supported by combing cream innovations across Latin America and the continued success of its 2023 relaunch. Dove grew high-single digit led by volume growth following the launch of Scalp + Hair Therapy, for improved scalp health and hair density. Clear and TRESemmé grew well with the continued expansion of our patented anti-dandruff shampoo and our new Lamellar Shine range.
Core Skin Care grew mid-single digit led by strong volume growth in our top brands. Vaseline grew strong double-digit supported by its premium ranges, including Radiant X and Gluta Hya, which continue to be rolled out to new markets. Pond’s continued to deliver high-single digit growth led by volume, following its 2023 relaunch.
Health & Wellbeing and Prestige Beauty combined delivered double-digit growth for the 14th consecutive quarter. This was led by very strong growth in Health & Wellbeing, while softer growth in Prestige Beauty reflected a slowdown in the US beauty market. Liquid IV grew strong double-digit with the continued success of its sugar-free variant, launch of new flavours supported by prominent social media campaigns, and ongoing international roll-out. Olly and Nutrafol contributed double-digit volume growth. In H1, Nutrafol extended into skin care with a daily supplement designed to address the root causes of acne and Olly drove good growth in China supported by its focus on female health supplements. Tatcha and Hourglass grew double-digit, while Paula’s Choice was affected by the market slowdown.
Underlying operating profit was €1.3 billion, up 11% versus prior year. Underlying operating margin increased 110bps to 20.0% driven by gross margin improvement, which supported a step-up in brand and marketing investment.

Personal Care (22% of Group turnover)

In Personal Care, we focus on winning with science-led brands that deliver unmissable superiority to our consumers across Deodorants, Skin Cleansing, and Oral Care. Our priorities include developing superior technology and multi-year innovation platforms, leveraging partnerships with our customers, and expanding into premium areas and digital channels

Home Care delivered underlying sales growth of 3.3%, with continued good volume growth of 4.6%, partially offset by (1.3)% price, driven primarily by emerging markets. Underlying sales growth of the Power Brands was up 3.7%.
Fabric Cleaning grew low-single digit with low-single digit volume and negative price. Growth was supported by the launch of Persil Wonder Wash, with our patented Pro-S technology, the first ever detergent designed for short cycle washes. This significant innovation has now been introduced in the UK, France and China and is on track to be rolled out to other key markets over the next 18 months. Europe grew double-digit with strong volumes. India and Brazil grew volume while price declined reflecting commodity deflation, notably in our powders portfolio. 
Home & Hygiene grew high-single digit with mid-single digit volume and slightly positive price. Cif and Domestos grew double-digit with double-digit volume. In H1, we expanded Domestos Power Foam to new markets and extended the range to include specialist solutions with long-lasting fragrance and limescale removal. Cif was supported by strong performances across Latin America in its cream and sprays portfolio.
Fabric Enhancers grew high-single digit led by volume, slightly offset by negative price. Comfort grew high-single digit supported by the launch of our new, Botanicals and Elixir ranges, with our patented CrystalFresh technology, delivering 10 times more fragrance.
Underlying operating profit was €1.0 billion, up 35% versus prior year. Underlying operating margin increased 400bps as commodity deflation supported a strong gross margin recovery, funding an increase in brand and marketing investment.

Nutrition (22% of Group turnover)

In Nutrition, our strategy is to deliver consistent, competitive growth by offering unmissably superior products through our biggest brands. We do this by reaching more consumers and focusing on top dishes and high consumption seasons to satisfy consumer’s preferences on taste, health and sustainability; while delivering productivity and resilience in our supply chain.

|  1 | First Half Review: Business Groups (continued) |

Scratch Cooking Aids grew mid-single digit with positive volume and price, led by Knorr. Growth was supported by double-digit performance in Latin America where Knorr’s innovation and marketing focus on local top dishes continues to drive growth across the portfolio. 
Dressings delivered low-single digit growth with positive volume and price. Hellmann’s grew mid-single digit with the continued strong performance of flavoured mayo that launched in additional markets and added new variants in North America and Europe. Brazil grew double-digit which was enhanced by strategic partnerships, including our second year as a sponsor of the National Basketball Association in Brazil.
Unilever Food Solutions grew high-single digit with mid-single digit volume, led by double-digit growth in China. Growth was driven by the latest edition of our Future Menu’s Trend report, sparking inspiration and sales in professional kitchens, and continued gains from our digital selling programme.
Underlying operating profit was €1.5 billion, up 23% versus prior year. Underlying operating margin increased 390bps with a strong recovery in gross margin driven by normalising commodity costs and SKU optimisation. Gross margin improvement supported an increase in brand and marketing investment.

Ice Cream (15% of Group turnover)

In Ice Cream, our immediate strategic priority is to expand operating profit and global market share. We will do this by building the unmissable superiority of our brands, accelerating market development in emerging markets, continuing to lead the industry on innovation and premiumisation, and by stepping up our performance and productivity. In March, we announced the planned separation of Ice Cream which we expect to be completed by the end of 2025. The separation will create a world-leading business, operating in a highly attractive category with five of the top 10 selling global ice cream brands.

Ice Cream had a disappointing start to its key season, with underlying sales up 0.6%. 1.6% underlying price growth was partially offset by negative volume of (1.0)%.
Performance remains below our ambition, having been impacted by a soft start to the European key season and challenging market dynamics in China. In-home Ice Cream delivered flat price and volume, while out-of-home Ice Cream grew low-single digit driven by price. 
Wall’s grew mid-single digit with positive volume and price, Ben & Jerry’s was slightly up, while sales of Cornetto were adversely affected by the decline in China. Magnum launched its new ‘Pleasure Express’ range with 3 variants: Euphoria, Wonder and Chill. 
Ice Cream continues to focus on operational improvements, including service and optimising promotions, while continuing to drive investment behind our brands and innovations.
Underlying operating profit was €0.7 billion, flat versus prior year. Underlying operating margin declined (40)bps as gross margin improvement was offset by an increase in brand and marketing investment. Cost inflation of key commodities continued, driven by cocoa and sugar.

Asia Pacific Africa (43% of Group turnover)

Underlying sales growth was 3.5% with 2.4% from volume and 1.0% from price. 
India grew 1.2% as volume sequentially improved in Q2 to 3.8%. Volume was partially offset by negative price linked to lower commodity costs in several categories. China declined reflecting weaker market growth in most of our categories and low consumer confidence. Despite the overall market dynamic, Unilever Food Solutions delivered double-digit growth in China, building on its double-digit growth in H1 2023. Underlying sales declined (5.7)% in Indonesia, with negative price and volume. This largely reflects the ongoing impact of some Indonesian consumers avoiding multinational brands and the need for operational improvements.
Africa grew double-digit with positive price and volume. Turkey delivered strong double-digit volume growth in a hyperinflationary environment.

The Americas (37% of Group turnover)

Underlying sales grew 3.4% in North America with 2.0% from volume and 1.4% from price. Beauty & Wellbeing delivered volume-led high-single digit growth, driven by a strong performance in Health & Wellbeing. Personal Care grew low-single digit driven by price as we lapped a particularly strong prior year comparator in Deodorants. Nutrition grew low-single digit with positive volume and price, led by continued growth in Dressings. Ice Cream was flat with positive volume and negative price as we optimised promotions.
Underlying sales in Latin America grew 8.8% with 7.0% volume and 1.6% price. Growth was broad-based with all Business Groups. Personal Care and Beauty & Wellbeing grew double-digit with strong volumes and positive price. Home Care contributed high-single digit volume growth, which was largely offset by negative price. Nutrition grew high-single digit with positive price and volume led by Knorr and Hellmann’s. Brazil grew high-single digit led by volume, with strong volume growth in Deodorants, Dressings, and Home Care categories. Price was negative largely due to commodity deflation in Home Care. Mexico grew double-digit with all Business Groups growing volume and price. Argentina performed well in a challenging environment, delivering double-digit volume growth despite hyperinflationary pricing.

Europe (20% of Group turnover)

Underlying sales grew 3.5% with 2.9% price and 0.5% volume growth. Helped by strong innovations and a step-up in brand support, Europe delivered 2.2% volume growth in Q2. It was the first positive UVG since Q2 2021 despite a soft start of the key ice cream season. Home Care and Personal Care grew double-digit led by volume growth, which was supported by strong innovations across Domestos, Persil, and Dove. Nutrition declined low-single digit but returned to growth in Q2 with positive volume. Ice Cream declined low-single digit impacted by poor weather. The United Kingdom, Germany and Eastern Europe grew well with positive volumes.

|  1 | Additional commentary on the financial statements - First Half |

Finance costs and tax
Net finance costs increased by €99 million to €358 million in 2024. This was largely driven by the higher cost of debt on bonds, a lower interest credit from pensions, partially offset by a slightly higher interest income. As a result, net finance costs were 2.9% on average net debt. For full year 2024, we now expect net finance costs of around 3% on average net debt. 
The underlying effective tax rate for the first half increased to 26.0% from 24.2% in the prior year, due to a number of factors including lower benefits from tax settlements and other one-off items. For full year 2024, we raise our guidance for the underlying effective tax rate to around 26%, from around 25% previously. The effective tax rate was 28.6%, up from 26.9% in the prior year.
Joint ventures, associates and other income from non-current investments
Net profit from joint ventures and associates was €138 million, an increase of €20 million compared to 2023, mainly driven by the Pepsi-Lipton JVs. Other income from non-current investments was negative at €(5) million, versus €(10) million in the prior year.
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share increased 16.3% to €1.62, including (1.0)% of adverse currency. The increase primarily reflects a strong operational performance and a reduction in the average number of shares as a result of the share buyback programme, which contributed 1.0%. These were partially offset by higher tax and net finance costs. Diluted earnings per share of €1.47 increased by 5.4% versus the prior year that was boosted by profits on disposal.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs were €248 million in the first half, up from €184 million in the prior year. For full year 2024, we anticipate restructuring costs of around 1.2% of Group turnover, with the step-up in the second half driven by cost related to the implementation of the productivity programme.
Free cash flow 
Free cash flow in the first half of 2024 was €2.2 billion versus €2.5 billion delivered in the first half of 2023. The increase in operating profit was more than offset by a higher seasonal outflow in working capital, a step-up in capital expenditure, and higher income tax paid. 
Net debt
Closing net debt was €25.2 billion compared to €23.7 billion as at 31 December 2023. This translated into a net debt / Underlying EBITDA ratio of 2.0x. The increase in net debt was driven by dividends paid, €375 million of the share buyback programme executed during the first half, partially offset by free cash flow delivery. 

Pensions

Pension assets net of liabilities were in surplus of €2.7 billion at 30 June 2024 versus a surplus of €2.4 billion at the end of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by strong investment returns in the first half.
Financial implications and impairment risk in Russia
Our Russia business employs approximately 3,000 people in Russia and in the first six months of 2024 the business represented around 1% of the Group’s turnover and net profit. As at 30 June 2024, our Russia business had net assets of around €600 million, including four factories. We continually review our position and still conclude that the containment actions we put in place at the beginning of the war minimise our economic contribution to the Russian state. 
We will continue to review and disclose the financial implications from the conflict. While the potential impacts remain uncertain, there remains a risk that our operations in Russia are unable to continue, leading to loss of turnover, profit and a write-down of assets.
Share buyback programme
On 8 February 2024, we announced a share buyback programme of up to €1.5 billion to be completed over 2024. The first tranche of up to €850 million commenced on 17 May. In the first half of 2024, we repurchased 7,315,036 ordinary shares which are held by Unilever as treasury shares. Consideration paid for the repurchase of shares including transaction costs was €375 million which is recorded within other reserves. The first tranche is expected to complete on or before 30 August 2024.

|  1 | Non-GAAP measures |
Certain discussions and analyses set out in this announcement include measures which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as IFRS. We believe this information, along with comparable GAAP measurements, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring our operating performance, ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities. Our management uses these financial measures, along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating performance and value creation. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP. Wherever appropriate and practical, we provide reconciliations to relevant GAAP measures.
Unilever uses ‘constant rate’, and ‘underlying’ measures primarily for internal performance analysis and targeting purposes. We present certain items, percentages and movements, using constant exchange rates, which exclude the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency values by translating both the current and the prior period local currency amounts using the prior year average exchange rates into euro, except for the local currency of entities that operate in hyperinflationary economies. These currencies are translated into euros using the prior year closing exchange rate before the application of IAS 29.
The table below shows exchange rate movements in our key markets.

Underlying sales growth (USG)
Underlying sales growth (USG) refers to the increase in turnover for the period, excluding any change in turnover resulting from acquisitions, disposals, changes in currency and price growth in excess of 26% in hyperinflationary economies. Inflation of 26% per year compounded over three years is one of the key indicators within IAS 29 to assess whether an economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary. We believe this measure provides valuable additional information on the underlying sales performance of the business and is a key measure used internally. The impact of acquisitions and disposals is excluded from USG for a period of 12 calendar months from the applicable closing date. Turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries where they were not previously sold is included in USG as such turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution network than the acquisition itself. 
The reconciliation of changes in the GAAP measure of turnover to USG is as follows:

*Underlying price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies has been excluded when calculating the underlying sales growth in the tables above, and an equal and opposite amount is shown as extreme price growth in hyperinflationary markets.
Underlying price growth (UPG)
Underlying price growth (UPG) is part of USG and means, for the applicable period, the increase in turnover attributable to changes in prices during the period. UPG therefore excludes the impact to USG due to (i) the volume of products sold; and (ii) the composition of products sold during the period. In determining changes in price, we exclude the impact of price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies as explained in USG above.
Underlying volume growth (UVG) 
Underlying volume growth (UVG) is part of USG and means, for the applicable period, the increase in turnover in such period calculated as the sum of (i) the increase in turnover attributable to the volume of products sold; and (ii) the increase in turnover attributable to the composition of products sold during such period. UVG therefore excludes any impact on USG due to changes in prices.
Non-underlying items
Several non-GAAP measures are adjusted to exclude items defined as non-underlying due to their nature and/or frequency of occurrence:
•Non-underlying items within operating profit are: gains or losses on business disposals, acquisition and disposal related costs, restructuring costs, impairments and other items within operating profit classified here due to their nature and frequency.
•Non-underlying items not in operating profit but within net profit are: net monetary gain/(loss) arising from hyperinflationary economies and significant and unusual items in net finance cost, share of profit/(loss) of joint ventures and associates and taxation.
•Non-underlying items are both non-underlying items within operating profit and those non-underlying items not in operating profit but within net profit.
Restructuring costs are charges associated with activities planned by management that significantly change either the scope of the business or the manner in which it is conducted.

Underlying operating profit (UOP) and underlying operating margin (UOM)
Underlying operating profit and underlying operating margin mean operating profit and operating margin before the impact of non-underlying items within operating profit. Underlying operating profit represents our measure of segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the segments. The reconciliation of operating profit to underlying operating profit is as follows:

Underlying effective tax rate 
The underlying effective tax rate is calculated by dividing taxation excluding the tax impact of non-underlying items by profit before tax excluding the impact of non-underlying items and share of net (profit)/loss of joint ventures and associates. This measure reflects the underlying tax rate in relation to profit before tax excluding non-underlying items before tax and share of net profit/(loss) of joint ventures and associates. Tax impact on non-underlying items within operating profit is the sum of the tax on each non-underlying item, based on the applicable country tax rates and tax treatment. This is shown in the following table: 
|    |                                                                                                                             |            |      |       |

Underlying earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share (underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders’ equity divided by the diluted average number of ordinary shares. In calculating underlying profit attributable to shareholders’ equity, net profit attributable to shareholders’ equity is adjusted to eliminate the post-tax impact of non-underlying items. This measure reflects the underlying earnings for each share unit of the Group. Refer to note 6 for reconciliation of net profit attributable to shareholders’ equity to underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity.
The reconciliation of net profit attributable to shareholders’ equity to underlying profit attributable to shareholders' equity is as follows:

Constant underlying EPS 
Constant underlying earnings per share (constant underlying EPS) is calculated as underlying profit attributable to shareholders’ equity at constant exchange rates and excluding the impact of both translational hedges and price growth in excess of 26% per year in hyperinflationary economies divided by the diluted average number of ordinary shares. This measure reflects the underlying earnings for each share unit of the Group in constant exchange rates.
The reconciliation of underlying profit attributable to shareholders’ equity to constant underlying earnings attributable to shareholders’ equity and the calculation of constant underlying EPS is as follows:

Net debt
Net debt is a measure that provides valuable additional information on the summary presentation of the Group’s net financial liabilities and is a measure in common use elsewhere. Net debt is defined as the excess of total financial liabilities, excluding trade payables and other current liabilities, over cash, cash equivalents and other current financial assets, excluding trade and other current receivables, and non-current financial asset derivatives that relate to financial liabilities. 
The reconciliation of total financial liabilities to net debt is as follows:

Free cash flow (FCF) 
Within the Unilever Group, free cash flow (FCF) is defined as cash flow from operating activities, less income taxes paid, net capital expenditure and net interest payments. It does not represent residual cash flows entirely available for discretionary purposes; for example, the repayment of principal amounts borrowed is not deducted from FCF. FCF reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that we believe is useful to investors because it represents cash flows that could be used for distribution of dividends, repayment of debt or to fund our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, if any.
The reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities to FCF is as follows:|    |                                                   |            |      |         |

|  1 | Principal Risk Factors |

On pages 71 to 78 of our 2023 Annual Report and Accounts we set out our assessment of the principal risk issues that would face the business under the headings: brand preference; portfolio management; climate change; plastic packaging; customer; talent; supply chain; safe and high quality products; systems and information; business transformation; economic and political instability; treasury and tax; ethical; and legal and regulatory. In our view, the nature and potential impact of such risks remain essentially unchanged as regards our performance over the second half of 2024.

These condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting' as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted for use in the UK. 
As required by the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that were applied in the preparation of the Group’s published consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023. In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies used by management have remained consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.

As a result, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to meet its obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing these condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the half year condensed consolidated financial statements.

Turnover growth is made up of distinct individual growth components namely underlying sales, currency impact, acquisitions and disposals. Turnover growth is arrived at by multiplying these individual components on a compounded basis as there is a currency impact on each of the other components. Accordingly, turnover growth is more than just the sum of the individual components.
Underlying operating profit represents our measure of segment profit or loss as it is the primary measure used for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of segments.

The earnings per share calculations are based on the average number of share units representing the ordinary shares of PLC in issue during the period, less the average number of shares held as treasury shares.

There were no significant changes in classification of fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities since 31 December 2023. There were also no significant movements between the fair value hierarchy classifications since 31 December 2023.
The fair value of trade receivables and payables is considered to be equal to the carrying amount of these items due to their short-term nature. The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities (excluding listed bonds) is considered to be same as the carrying amount for 2024 and 2023.
Calculation of fair values 
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent with those used in the year ended 31 December 2023.
