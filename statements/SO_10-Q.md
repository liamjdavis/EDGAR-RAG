|  1 | Item 2.02 | Results of Operations and Financial Condition |

The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, such information, including the exhibits attached hereto, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
On August 1, 2024, The Southern Company (“Southern Company”) issued a press release regarding its earnings for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024, including certain additional information regarding the financial results for such period. A copy of this release is being furnished as Exhibit 99 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Exhibit 99 to this Current Report on Form 8-K includes earnings and earnings per share in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The exhibit also includes earnings and earnings per share (1) for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, excluding charges (net of salvage proceeds) and credits, associated legal expenses (net of insurance recoveries), and tax impacts related to plants under construction, (2) for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023, excluding costs associated with the extinguishment of debt at Southern Company, and (3) for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2023, excluding a charge related to a disallowance at Northern Illinois Gas Company. The attached exhibit includes additional information regarding these excluded items, as well as reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable financial measure under GAAP. Southern Company believes the presentation of earnings and earnings per share, excluding these items, is useful to investors because it provides investors with additional information to evaluate the performance of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. Southern Company management also 
uses earnings and earnings per share, excluding the effect of these items, to evaluate the performance of Southern Company’s ongoing business activities.  The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibits

Exhibit 99 contains business segment information for Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Southern Power Company and Southern Company Gas. Accordingly, this report is also being furnished on behalf of each such registrant.
