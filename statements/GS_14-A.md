|  1 | Subject to Completion. Dated August 1, 2024.GS Finance Corp. $Autocallable Contingent Coupon Equity-Linked Notes dueguaranteed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. |

 If the closing price of the common stock of Carnival Corporation on any observation date is less than 60% of the initial index stock price (set on the trade date (expected to be August 5, 2024) and will be an intra-day price or the closing price of one share of the index stock on the trade date), you will not receive a coupon on the applicable payment date. The amount that you will be paid on your notes is based on the performance of the index stock. The notes will mature on the stated maturity date (expected to be August 10, 2026), unless automatically called on any observation date commencing in February 2025 to and including May 2026. Your notes will be automatically called if the closing price of the index stock on any such observation date is greater than or equal to the initial index stock price. If your notes are automatically called, you will receive a payment on the next payment date (expected to be each date specified as such on page S-4 of this prospectus supplement) equal to the face amount of your notes plus a coupon (as described below).
Observation dates are expected to be each date specified as such on page S-4 of this prospectus supplement, commencing in November 2024 and ending in August 2026. If on any observation date the closing price of the index stock is greater than or equal to 60% of the initial index stock price, you will receive on the applicable payment date a coupon for each $1,000 face amount of your notes equal to $34.375 (3.4375% quarterly, or the potential for up to 13.75% per annum).
 The amount that you will be paid on your notes at maturity, if they have not been automatically called, in addition to the final coupon, if any, is based on the index stock return. The index stock return is the percentage increase or decrease in the closing price of the index stock on the determination date (the final observation date, expected to be August 5, 2026) from the initial index stock price.
At maturity, for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:
 •if the index stock return is greater than or equal to -40% (the final index stock price is greater than or equal to 60% of the initial index stock price), $1,000 plus the final coupon; or 
 •if the index stock return is less than -40% (the final index stock price is less than 60% of the initial index stock price), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) the index stock return times (b) $1,000. You will receive less than 60% of the face amount of your notes and no coupon.
 If the index stock return is less than -40%, the percentage of the face amount of your notes you will receive will be based on the index stock return. In such event, you will receive less than 60% of the face amount of your notes and no coupon.
 You should read the disclosure herein to better understand the terms and risks of your investment, including the credit risk of GS Finance Corp. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. See page S-20.

On and after , the price (not including GS&Co.’s customary bid and ask spreads) at which GS&Co. would buy or sell your notes (if it makes a market) will equal approximately the then-current estimated value of your notes determined by reference to such pricing models. |

 Closing price: on any trading day, with respect to the index stock, the closing sale price or last reported sale price, regular way, for such index stock, on a per-share or other unit basis:
 •on the principal national securities exchange on which such index stock is listed for trading on that day, or 
 •if such index stock is not listed on any national securities exchange on that day, on any other U.S. national market system that is the primary market for the trading of such index stock. 
 If the index stock is not listed or traded as described above, then the closing price for such index stock on any day will be the average, as determined by the calculation agent, of the bid prices for such index stock obtained from as many dealers in such index stock selected by the calculation agent as will make those bid prices available to the calculation agent. The number of dealers need not exceed three and may include the calculation agent or any of its or the company’s affiliates.
 S-4


The closing price of the index stock is subject to adjustment as described under “— Anti-dilution adjustments” below.
 Trading day: a day on which the principal securities market for the index stock is open for trading
 Index stock issuer: with respect to the index stock, the issuer of such index stock as then in effect
 Market disruption event: With respect to any given trading day, any of the following will be a market disruption event:
 •a suspension, absence or material limitation of trading in the index stock on its primary market for more than two consecutive hours of trading or during the one-half hour before the close of trading in that market, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion,
 •a suspension, absence or material limitation of trading in option or futures contracts relating to the index stock in the primary market for those contracts for more than two consecutive hours of trading or during the one-half hour before the close of trading in that market, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion, or 
 •the index stock does not trade on what was the primary market for the index stock, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion,
 and, in the case of any of these events, the calculation agent determines in its sole discretion that such event could materially interfere with the ability of the company or any of its affiliates or a similarly situated person to unwind all or a material portion of a hedge that could be effected with respect to this note.
The following events will not be market disruption events:
 •a limitation on the hours or numbers of days of trading, but only if the limitation results from an announced change in the regular business hours of the relevant market, and
 •a decision to permanently discontinue trading in option or futures contracts relating to the index stock.
 For this purpose, an “absence of trading” in the primary securities market on which shares of the index stock are traded, or on which option or futures contracts relating to the index stock are traded, will not include any time when that market is itself closed for trading under ordinary circumstances. In contrast, a suspension or limitation of trading in shares of the index stock or in option or futures contracts, if available, relating to the index stock in the primary market for that index stock or those contracts, by reason of:
 •a price change exceeding limits set by that market,
 •an imbalance of orders relating to the shares of the index stock or those contracts, or
 •a disparity in bid and ask quotes relating to the shares of the index stock or those contracts,
 will constitute a suspension or material limitation of trading in shares of the index stock or those contracts in that market.
 Consequences of a market disruption event or a non-trading day: If a market disruption event occurs or is continuing on a day that would otherwise be a coupon observation date or the determination date, or such day is not a trading day, then such coupon observation date or the determination date will be postponed as described under “— Coupon observation dates” or “— Determination date” above. If the closing price of the index stock that must be used to determine the coupon payable on the coupon payment date, if any, or the cash settlement amount, as applicable, is not available on the last possible coupon observation date or the last possible determination date, as applicable, because of a market disruption event, a non-trading day or for any other reason (except as described under “— Anti-dilution adjustments” below), then the calculation agent will nevertheless determine the index stock price based on its assessment, in its sole discretion, of the price of the index stock at the applicable time on that day.
 Regular record dates: the scheduled business day immediately preceding the day on which payment is to be made (as such payment date may be adjusted)
 Anti-dilution adjustments: The calculation agent will adjust the reference amount of the index stock in respect of each event for which adjustment is required under any of the six subsections beginning with “Stock splits” below (and not in respect of any other event). (If more than one such event occurs, the calculation agent shall adjust the reference amount as so provided for each such event, sequentially, in the order in which such events occur, and
S-5


on a cumulative basis.) Having adjusted the reference amount for any and all such events as so provided, the calculation agent shall determine a closing price for the reference amount as so adjusted on the coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable. (If the reference amount is adjusted pursuant to “Reorganization events” below so as to consist of distribution property, then the closing price on any coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, shall equal the sum of the respective closing prices or other values for all such distribution property on such coupon observation date or the determination date, as provided in “Reorganization events” below.) Having determined the closing price on any coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, the calculation agent shall use such prices to calculate the coupon, if applicable, the occurrence of a redemption event, or the cash settlement amount. The calculation agent shall make all adjustments no later than the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this note, if an event for which adjustment is required under any of the six subsections beginning with “Stock splits” below occurs, the calculation agent may make the adjustment and any related determinations and calculations in a manner that differs from that specified in this note as necessary to achieve an equitable result. Upon written request by the holder to the calculation agent, the calculation agent will provide the holder with such information about these adjustments as such agent determines is appropriate.
 Stock splits. A stock split is an increase in the number of a corporation’s outstanding shares of stock without any change in its stockholders’ equity. Each outstanding share will be worth less as a result of a stock split. If the index stock is subject to a stock split, then at the opening of business on the first day on which such index stock trades without the right to receive the stock split, the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount to equal the sum of the reference amount in effect immediately prior to such adjustment plus the product of (i) the number of new shares issued in the stock split with respect to one share of such index stock times (ii) the reference amount in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. The reference amount will not be adjusted, however, unless such first day occurs after the trade date and on or before the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.
 Reverse stock splits. A reverse stock split is a decrease in the number of a corporation’s outstanding shares of stock without any change in its stockholders’ equity. Each outstanding share will be worth more as a result of a reverse stock split. If the index stock is subject to a reverse stock split, then once the reverse stock split becomes effective, the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount to equal the product of the reference amount in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the quotient of (i) the number of shares of such index stock outstanding immediately after the reverse stock split becomes effective divided by (ii) the number of shares of such index stock outstanding immediately before the reverse stock split becomes effective. The reference amount will not be adjusted, however, unless the reverse stock split becomes effective after the trade date and on or before the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.
 Stock dividends. In a stock dividend, a corporation issues additional shares of its stock to all holders of its outstanding shares of its stock in proportion to the shares they own. Each outstanding share will be worth less as a result of a stock dividend. If the index stock is subject to a stock dividend that is given ratably to all holders of such index stock, then at the opening of business on the ex-dividend date, the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount to equal the reference amount in effect immediately prior to such adjustment plus the product of (i) the number of shares issued in the stock dividend with respect to one share of such index stock times (ii) the reference amount in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. The reference amount will not be adjusted, however, unless such ex-dividend date occurs after the trade date and on or before the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.
 Other dividends and distributions. There will be no adjustments to the reference amount to reflect dividends or other distributions paid with respect to the index stock other than:
 •stock dividends as provided in “Stock dividends” above, 
 •issuances of transferable rights or warrants as provided in “Transferable rights and warrants” below, 
 •dividends or other distributions constituting spin-off events as provided in “Reorganization events” below, or 
 •extraordinary dividends described below. 
 A dividend or other distribution with respect to the index stock will be deemed to be an “extraordinary dividend” if its per share value of such dividend or other distribution exceeds the per share value of the immediately
S-6


preceding dividend or distribution with respect to such index stock, if any, that is not an extraordinary dividend by an amount equal to at least 10% of the closing price of such index stock on the trading day immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for such extraordinary dividend.
If an extraordinary dividend occurs with respect to the index stock, the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount to equal the product of (a) the reference amount in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the closing price of such index stock on the trading day immediately preceding the ex-dividend date and the denominator of which is the amount by which such closing price exceeds the extraordinary dividend amount.
The “extraordinary dividend amount” with respect to an extraordinary dividend for the index stock will equal:
 •in the case of an extraordinary dividend that is paid in lieu of a regular quarterly dividend, the amount per share of such extraordinary dividend minus the amount per share of the immediately preceding dividend or distribution with respect to such index stock, if any, that is not an extraordinary dividend or
 •in the case of an extraordinary dividend that is not paid in lieu of a regular quarterly dividend, the amount per share of such extraordinary dividend. 
 To the extent an extraordinary dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the non-cash component will be determined by the calculation agent. A distribution on the index stock that constitutes a stock dividend, an issuance of transferable rights or warrants or a spin-off event and also constitutes an extraordinary dividend will result only in an adjustment to the reference amount pursuant to “Stock dividends” above, “Transferable rights and warrants” below or “Reorganization events” below, as applicable. The reference amount will not be adjusted pursuant to this subsection unless the ex-dividend date for the extraordinary dividend occurs after the trade date and on or before the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.
 Transferable rights and warrants. If the index stock issuer issues transferable rights or warrants to all holders of the index stock to subscribe for or purchase the index stock at an exercise price per share less than the closing price of the index stock on the trading day immediately before the ex-dividend date for such issuance, then the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount by multiplying the reference amount in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction:
 •the numerator of which is the number of shares of index stock outstanding at the close of business on the day before such ex-dividend date plus the number of additional shares of index stock offered for subscription or purchase under such transferable rights or warrants, and 
 •the denominator of which is the number of shares of index stock outstanding at the close of business on the day before such ex-dividend date plus the number of additional shares of index stock that the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of index stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at the closing price of the index stock on the trading day immediately before such ex-dividend date, with such number of additional shares being determined by multiplying the total number of shares so offered by the exercise price of such transferable rights or warrants and dividing the resulting product by the closing price of the index stock on the trading day immediately before such ex-dividend date. 
 The reference amount will not be adjusted, however, unless such ex-dividend date occurs after the trade date and on or before the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.

 Reorganization events. With respect to the index stock, if:

•any reclassification or other change of the index stock occurs, 
 •the index stock issuer has been subject to a merger, consolidation, amalgamation, binding share exchange or other business combination and is not the surviving entity or it does survive but all the shares of index stock are reclassified or changed, 
 •the index stock has been subject to a takeover, tender offer, exchange offer, solicitation proposal or other event by another person to purchase or otherwise obtain all of the outstanding shares of the index stock, such that all of the outstanding shares of the index stock (other than shares of the index stock owned or controlled by such other person) are transferred, or irrevocably committed to be transferred, to another person,
 •the index stock issuer or any subsidiary of the index stock issuer has been subject to a merger, consolidation, amalgamation or binding share exchange in which the index stock issuer is the surviving entity and all the 
 S-7


outstanding shares of the index stock (other than shares of the index stock owned or controlled by such other person) immediately prior to such event collectively represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of the index stock immediately following such event,
•the index stock issuer sells or otherwise transfers its property and assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to another entity
 •the index stock issuer issues to all holders of index stock equity securities of an issuer other than the index stock issuer (other than in a transaction described in any of the bullet points above) (a “spin-off event”), 
 •the index stock issuer is liquidated, dissolved or wound up or is subject to a proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or
 •any other corporate or similar events that affect or could potentially affect market prices of, or shareholders’ rights in, the index stock or distribution property, which will be substantiated by an official characterization by either the Options Clearing Corporation with respect to options contracts on the index stock or by the primary securities exchange on which the index stock or listed options on the index stock are traded, and will ultimately be determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion (any such event in this bullet point or any of the bullet points above in this subsection, a “reorganization event”), 
 then the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount so that the reference amount consists of the respective amounts of each type of distribution property deemed, for the purposes of this note, to be distributed in such reorganization event in respect of the reference amount as in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, taken together.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the calculation agent will not make any adjustment for a reorganization event unless the event becomes effective — or, if the event is a spin-off event, unless the ex-dividend date for the spin-off event occurs — after the trade date and on or before the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.
 The calculation agent will determine the value of each component type of distribution property, using the closing price on the relevant day for any such type consisting of securities and such other method as it determines to be appropriate, in its sole discretion, for any other type. If a holder of the index stock may elect to receive different types or combinations of types of distribution property in the reorganization event, the distribution property will be deemed to include the types and amounts thereof distributed to a holder that makes no election, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion. If a reorganization event occurs and as a result the reference amount is adjusted to consist of distribution property, the calculation agent will make further adjustments for subsequent events that affect such distribution property or any component type thereof, to the same extent that it would make adjustments if the index stock were outstanding and were affected by the same kinds of events. The closing price on a coupon observation date or the determination date will be the total value, as determined by the calculation agent at the close of trading hours of the index stock on such coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, of all components of the reference amount, with each component having been adjusted on a sequential and cumulative basis for all relevant events affecting it.
 The calculation agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the adjustments described in “Reorganization events” as necessary to ensure an equitable result.
 If at any time the reference amount consists of distribution property, as determined by the calculation agent, then all references in this note to the “index stock” shall thereupon be deemed to mean such distribution property and all references in this note to a “share of index stock” shall thereupon be deemed to mean a comparable unit of each type of property comprising such distribution property, as determined by the calculation agent.
 Minimum adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be required in respect of any event specified in “Stock splits”, “Reverse stock splits”, “Stock dividends”, “Other dividends and distributions” and “Transferable rights and warrants” above unless such adjustment would result in a change of at least 0.1% in the closing price of such index stock. The closing price of the index stock resulting from any adjustment shall be rounded up or down, as appropriate, to the nearest ten-thousandth, with five hundred-thousandths being rounded upward — e.g., 0.12344 will be rounded down to 0.1234 and 0.12345 will be rounded up to 0.1235.
 Distribution property: cash, securities and/or other property distributed in any reorganization event in respect of the relevant reference amount and, in the case of a spin-off event, includes such reference amount
 S-8


Ex-dividend date: for any dividend or other distribution with respect to the index stock, the first day on which the index stock trades without the right to receive such dividend or other distribution
 Reference amount: with respect to the index stock, initially, one share of such index stock which shall be adjusted, as to the amount(s) and/or type(s) of property comprising the same, by the calculation agent as provided under “Anti-dilution adjustments” above
 Business day: each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close. A day is a scheduled business day if, as of the trade date, such day is scheduled to be a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday that is not a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close.

 Calculation agent: Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“GS&Co.”)

 Default amount: If an event of default occurs and the maturity of this note is accelerated, the company will pay the default amount in respect of the principal of this note at the maturity, instead of the amount payable on the stated maturity date as described earlier. The default amount for the notes on any day (except as provided in the last sentence under “Default quotation period” below) will be an amount, in U.S. dollars, for the face amount of this note, equal to the cost of having a qualified financial institution, of the kind and selected as described below, expressly assume all of the company’s payment and other obligations with respect to this note as of that day and as if no default or acceleration had occurred, or to undertake other obligations providing substantially equivalent economic value to you with respect to this note. That cost will equal:
 •the lowest amount that a qualified financial institution would charge to effect this assumption or undertaking, plus
 •the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by the holder of this note in preparing any documentation necessary for this assumption or undertaking.
 During the default quotation period for this note, which is described below, the holder of the notes and/or the company may request a qualified financial institution to provide a quotation of the amount it would charge to effect this assumption or undertaking. If either party obtains a quotation, it must notify the other party in writing of the quotation. The amount referred to in the first bullet point above will equal the lowest — or, if there is only one, the only — quotation obtained, and as to which notice is so given, during the default quotation period. With respect to any quotation, however, the party not obtaining the quotation may object, on reasonable and significant grounds, to the assumption or undertaking by the qualified financial institution providing the quotation and notify the other party in writing of those grounds within two business days after the last day of the default quotation period, in which case that quotation will be disregarded in determining the default amount.
 Default quotation period: The default quotation period is the period beginning on the day the default amount first becomes due and ending on the third business day after that day, unless:
 •no quotation of the kind referred to above is obtained, or
 •every quotation of that kind obtained is objected to within five business days after the day the default amount first becomes due.
 If either of these two events occurs, the default quotation period will continue until the third business day after the first business day on which prompt notice of a quotation is given as described above. If that quotation is objected to as described above within five business days after that first business day, however, the default quotation period will continue as described in the prior sentence and this sentence.
 In any event, if the default quotation period and the subsequent two business day objection period have not ended before the determination date, then the default amount will equal the principal amount of this note.
 Qualified financial institutions: For the purpose of determining the default amount at any time, a qualified financial institution must be a financial institution organized under the laws of any jurisdiction in the United States of America, Europe or Japan, which at that time has outstanding debt obligations with a stated maturity of one year or less from the date of issue and that is, or whose securities are, rated either:
 •A-1 or higher by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or any successor, or any other comparable rating then used by that rating agency, or
 S-9


•P-1 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or any successor, or any other comparable rating then used by that rating agency.
 Tax characterization: The holder, on behalf of itself and any other person having a beneficial interest in this note, hereby agrees with the company (in the absence of a change in law, an administrative determination or a judicial ruling to the contrary) to characterize this note for all U.S. federal income tax purposes as an income-bearing pre-paid derivative contract in respect of the index stock.
 Overdue principal rate and overdue coupon rate: the effective Federal Funds rate
 Defeasance: not applicable

DEFAULT AMOUNT ON ACCELERATION

 If an event of default occurs and the maturity of your notes is accelerated, the company will pay the default amount in respect of the principal of your notes at the maturity, instead of the amount payable on the stated maturity date as described earlier. We describe the default amount under “Terms and Conditions” above. For the purpose of determining whether the holders of our Series F medium-term notes, which include your notes, are entitled to take any action under the indenture, we will treat the outstanding face amount of your notes as the outstanding principal amount of that note. Although the terms of the offered notes differ from those of the other Series F medium-term notes, holders of specified percentages in principal amount of all Series F medium-term notes, together in some cases with other series of our debt securities, will be able to take action affecting all the Series F medium-term notes, including your notes, except with respect to certain Series F medium-term notes if the terms of such notes specify that the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of all of such notes must also consent to such action. This action may involve changing some of the terms that apply to the Series F medium-term notes or waiving some of our obligations under the indenture. In addition, certain changes to the indenture and the notes that only affect certain debt securities may be made with the approval of holders of a majority in principal amount of such affected debt securities. We discuss these matters in the accompanying prospectus under “Description of Debt Securities We May Offer — Default, Remedies and Waiver of Default” and “Description of Debt Securities We May Offer — Modification of the Debt Indentures and Waiver of Covenants”.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES

 
Payment Examples

 The following examples are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate (i) the impact that various hypothetical closing prices of the index stock on a coupon observation date could have on the coupon payable, if any, on the related coupon payment date and (ii) the impact that various hypothetical closing prices of the index stock on the determination date could have on the cash settlement amount at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.
 The examples below are based on a range of index stock prices that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the closing price of the index stock will be on any day throughout the life of your notes, what the closing price of the index stock will be on any coupon observation date or call observation date, as the case may be, and what the final index stock price will be on the determination date. The index stock has been highly volatile in the past — meaning that the index stock price has changed substantially in relatively short periods — and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.
 The information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the offered notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the face amount and held to a call payment date or the stated maturity date. If you sell your notes in a secondary market prior to a call payment date or the stated maturity date, as the case may be, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the examples below such as interest rates, the volatility of the index stock, the creditworthiness of GS Finance Corp., as issuer, and the creditworthiness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor. In addition, the estimated value of your notes at the time the terms of your notes are set on the trade date (as determined by reference to pricing models used by GS&Co.) is less than the original issue price of your notes. For more information on the estimated value of your notes, see “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes — The Estimated Value of Your Notes At the Time the Terms of Your Notes Are Set On the Trade Date (as Determined By Reference to Pricing Models Used By GS&Co.) Is Less Than the Original Issue Price Of Your Notes” on page S-20 of this prospectus supplement. The information in the examples also reflects the key terms and assumptions in the box below.

 Moreover, we have not yet set the initial index stock price that will serve as the baseline for determining the coupon payable on each coupon payment date, if any, if the notes will be automatically called, the index stock return and the amount that we will pay on your notes, if any, on the call payment date or at maturity. We will not do so until the trade date. As a result, the actual initial index stock price may differ substantially from the index stock price prior to the trade date. It may also differ substantially from the index stock price at the time you purchase your notes.
For these reasons, the actual performance of the index stock over the life of your notes, the actual index stock price on any call observation date or coupon observation date, as well as the coupon payable, if any, on each coupon payment date, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical index stock price shown elsewhere in this prospectus supplement.

the index stock price during recent periods, see “The Index Stock — Historical Closing Prices of the Index Stock” on page S-30. Before investing in the notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the index stock prices between the date of this prospectus supplement and the date of your purchase of the notes.
 Also, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the index stock.
 
Hypothetical Coupon Payments

 The examples below show the hypothetical performance of the index stock as well as the hypothetical coupons, if any, that we would pay on each coupon payment date with respect to each $1,000 face amount of the notes if the hypothetical closing price of the index stock on the applicable coupon observation date was the percentage of the initial index stock price shown.

 In Scenario 1, the hypothetical closing price of the index stock increases and decreases by varying amounts on each hypothetical coupon observation date. Because the hypothetical closing price of the index stock on the second and fourth hypothetical coupon observation dates is greater than or equal to the coupon trigger price, the total of the hypothetical coupons in Scenario 1 is $68.75. Because the hypothetical closing price of the index stock on all other hypothetical coupon observation dates is less than the coupon trigger price, no further coupons will be paid, including at maturity.

 In Scenario 2, the hypothetical closing price of the index stock increases and decreases by varying amounts on each hypothetical coupon observation date. Because in each case the hypothetical closing price of the index stock on the related coupon observation date is less than the coupon trigger price, you will not receive a coupon payment on the applicable hypothetical coupon payment date. Since this occurs on every hypothetical coupon observation date, the overall return you earn on your notes will be less than zero. Therefore, the total of the hypothetical coupons in Scenario 2 is $0.

 In Scenario 3, the hypothetical closing price of the index stock is less than the initial index stock price on the first hypothetical coupon observation date, but increases to a price that is greater than the initial index stock price on the second hypothetical coupon observation date. Because the hypothetical closing price of the index stock is greater than or equal to the initial index stock price on the second hypothetical coupon observation date (which is also the first hypothetical call observation date), your notes will be automatically called. Therefore, on the corresponding hypothetical call payment date, in addition to the hypothetical coupon of $34.375, you will receive an amount in cash equal to $1,000 for each $1,000 face amount of your notes.
 
Hypothetical Payment at Maturity

 If the notes are not automatically called on any call observation date (i.e., on each call observation date the closing price of the index stock is less than the initial index stock price), the cash settlement amount we would deliver for each $1,000 face amount of your notes on the stated maturity date will depend on the performance of the index stock on the determination date, as shown in the table below. The table below assumes that the notes have not been automatically called on a call observation date, does not include the final coupon, if any, and reflects hypothetical cash settlement amounts that you could receive on the stated maturity date. If the final index stock price (as a percentage of the initial index stock price) is less than the coupon trigger price, you will not be paid a final coupon at maturity.
 The prices in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final index stock prices and are expressed as percentages of the initial index stock price. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical cash settlement amounts, based on the corresponding hypothetical final index stock price, and are expressed as percentages of the face amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical cash settlement amount of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding face amount of the offered notes on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the face amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final index stock price and the assumptions noted above.

 If, for example, the notes have not been automatically called on a call observation date and the final index stock price were determined to be 25.000% of the initial index stock price, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be 25.000% of the face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date at the face amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose 75.000% of your investment (if you purchased your notes at a premium to face amount you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). In addition, if the final index stock price were determined to be 200.000% of the initial index stock price, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be limited to 100.000% of each $1,000 face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you held your notes to the stated maturity date, you would not benefit from any increase in the final index stock price over the initial index stock price.
 The cash settlement amounts shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on market prices for the index stock that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the offered notes. The hypothetical cash settlement amounts on notes held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your notes at their face amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual issue price you pay for your notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your notes. If you purchase your notes for a price other than the face amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples. Please read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes — The Market Value of Your Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors” on page S-22.
 Payments on the notes are economically equivalent to the amounts that would be paid on a combination of other instruments. For example, payments on the notes are economically equivalent to a combination of an interest-bearing bond bought by the holder and one or more options entered into between the holder and us (with one or more implicit option premiums paid over time). The discussion in this paragraph does not modify or affect the terms of the notes or the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the notes, as described elsewhere in this prospectus supplement.

|  1 | We cannot predict the actual closing price of the index stock on any day, the final index stock price or what the market value of your notes will be on any particular trading day, nor can we predict the relationship between the closing price of the index stock and the market value of your notes at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The actual coupon payment, if any, that a holder of the notes will receive on each coupon payment date, the actual amount that you will receive at maturity, if any, and the rate of return on the offered notes will depend on whether or not the notes are automatically called and the actual initial index stock price, which we will set on the trade date, and on the actual closing prices of the index stock on the coupon observation dates and the actual final index stock price determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical examples are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the coupon to be paid in respect of your notes, if any, and the cash amount to be paid in respect of your notes on the stated maturity date, if any, may be very different from the information reflected in the examples above. |

Anti-dilution Adjustment Examples

 The calculation agent will adjust the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, only if an event described under one of the six subsections beginning with “Stock splits” under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” occurs and only if the relevant event occurs during the period described under the applicable subsection. The adjustments described under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” do not cover all events that could affect the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, such as an issuer tender or exchange offer for such index stock at a premium to its market price or a tender or exchange offer made by a third party for less than all outstanding shares of such index stock. We describe the risks relating to dilution under “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes — You Have Limited Anti-dilution Protection” below.

How Adjustments Will Be Made

 In this prospectus supplement, we refer to anti-dilution adjustment of the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable. With respect to the index stock, if an event requiring anti-dilution adjustment occurs, the calculation agent will make the adjustment by taking the following steps:
Step One. The calculation agent will adjust the reference amount. This term refers to the amount of the index stock or other property that must be used to determine the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable. For example, if no adjustment described under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” is required at a time, the reference amount for that time will be one share of the index stock. In that case, the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, will be the closing price of one share of the index stock on the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date. We describe how the closing price will be determined under “Terms and Conditions — Closing price” above.
If an adjustment described under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” is required because one of the dilution events described in the first five subsections beginning with “Stock splits” under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” — these involve stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, other dividends and distributions and issuances of transferable rights and warrants — occurs, then the adjusted reference amount at that time might instead be, for example, two shares of the index stock or a half share of the index stock, depending on the event. In that example, the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, would be the price (determined as specified under “Terms and Conditions — Closing price” above) at the close of trading on the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date of two shares of the index stock or a half share of the index stock, as applicable.
If an adjustment described under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” is required at a time because one of the reorganization events described under “Terms and Conditions — Reorganization events” — these involve events in which cash, securities or other property is distributed in respect of the index stock — occurs, then the reference amount at that time will be adjusted to be as follows, assuming there has been no prior or subsequent anti-dilution adjustment: the amount of each type of the property distributed in the reorganization event in respect of one share of the index stock, plus one share of the index stock if the index stock remains outstanding. In that event, the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, would be the value of the adjusted reference amount at the close of trading on such coupon observation date or the determination date.
The manner in which the calculation agent adjusts the reference amount in step one will depend on the type of dilution event requiring adjustment. These events and the nature of the required adjustments are described in the six subsections beginning with “Stock splits” under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments”.
Step Two. Having adjusted the reference amount in step one, the calculation agent will determine the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, in the following manner.
If the adjusted reference amount at the applicable time consists entirely of shares of the index stock, the index stock price will be the closing price (determined as described under “Terms and Conditions — Closing price” above) of the adjusted reference amount on the applicable date.
S-17


On the other hand, if the adjusted reference amount at the applicable time includes any property other than shares of the index stock, the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, will be the value of the adjusted reference amount as determined by the calculation agent in the manner described under “— Adjustments for Reorganization Events” below at the applicable time.
Step Three. Having determined the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, in step two, the calculation agent will use such price to calculate the coupon payable on the applicable coupon payment date, if any, or the cash settlement amount.
 If more than one event requiring adjustment as described under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” occurs, the calculation agent will first adjust the reference amount as described in step one above for each event, sequentially, in the order in which the events occur, and on a cumulative basis. Thus, having adjusted the reference amount for the first event, the calculation agent will repeat step one for the second event, applying the required adjustment to the reference amount as already adjusted for the first event, and so on for each event. Having adjusted the reference amount for all events, the calculation agent will then take the remaining applicable steps in the process described above, determining the closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, using the reference amount as sequentially and cumulatively adjusted for all the relevant events. The calculation agent will make all required determinations and adjustments no later than the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.
The calculation agent will adjust the reference amount for each reorganization event described under “Terms and Conditions — Reorganization events” above. For any other dilution event described above, however, the calculation agent will not be required to adjust the reference amount unless the adjustment would result in a change of at least 0.1% in the index stock price that would apply without the adjustment. The closing price of the index stock on a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, resulting from any adjustment will be rounded up or down, as appropriate, to the nearest ten-thousandth, with five hundred-thousandths being rounded upward — e.g., 0.12344 will be rounded down to 0.1234 and 0.12345 will be rounded up to 0.1235.
If an event requiring anti-dilution adjustment occurs, the calculation agent will make the adjustment with a view to offsetting, to the extent practical, any change in the economic position of the holder, GS Finance Corp., as issuer, and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor, relative to your notes, that results solely from that event. The calculation agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the anti-dilution adjustments as necessary to ensure an equitable result.
 The calculation agent will make all determinations with respect to anti-dilution adjustments, including any determination as to whether an event requiring adjustment has occurred, as to the nature of the adjustment required and how it will be made or as to the value of any property distributed in a reorganization event, and will do so in its sole discretion. In the absence of manifest error, those determinations will be conclusive for all purposes and will be binding on you and us, without any liability on the part of the calculation agent. The calculation agent will provide information about the adjustments it makes upon written request by the holder.
In this prospectus supplement, when we say that the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount for one or more dilution events, we mean that the calculation agent will take all the applicable steps described above with respect to those events.
The six subsections beginning with “Stock splits” under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” describe the dilution events for which the reference amount is to be adjusted. Each subsection describes the manner in which the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount — the first step in the adjustment process described above — for the relevant event.

Adjustments for Reorganization Events

 If a reorganization event occurs, then the calculation agent will adjust the reference amount so that it consists of the amount of each type of distribution property described under “Terms and Conditions — Reorganization events” above distributed in respect of one share of the index stock — or in respect of whatever the prior reference amount may be — in the reorganization event, taken together. For purposes of the three-step adjustment process described under “— How Adjustments Will Be Made” above, the distribution property so distributed will be the adjusted reference amount described in step one, the value of that property at the close of trading hours for the index stock on the applicable date will be the index stock price described in step two, and the calculation agent will determine the coupon payable on a
S-18


coupon payment date, if any, or the cash settlement amount as described in step three. As described under “— How Adjustments Will Be Made” above, the calculation agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the adjustments described in this paragraph as necessary to ensure an equitable result.
The calculation agent will determine the value of each type of distribution property in its sole discretion. For any distribution property consisting of a security, the calculation agent will use the closing price (calculated according to the same methodology as specified in this prospectus supplement, without any anti-dilution adjustments) of one share of such security on the applicable date. The calculation agent may value other types of property in any manner it determines, in its sole discretion, to be appropriate. If a holder of the index stock may elect to receive different types or combinations of types of distribution property in the reorganization event, the distribution property will consist of the types and amounts of each type distributed to a holder that makes no election, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion. As described under “— How Adjustments Will Be Made” above, the calculation agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the adjustments described in this paragraph as necessary to ensure an equitable result.
If a reorganization event occurs and the calculation agent adjusts the reference amount to consist of the distribution property distributed in the reorganization event, as described above, the calculation agent will make any further anti-dilution adjustments for later events that affect the distribution property, or any component of the distribution property, comprising the new reference amount. The calculation agent will do so to the same extent that it would make adjustments if the index stock were outstanding and were affected by the same kinds of events. If a subsequent reorganization event affects only a particular component of the reference amount, the required adjustment will be made with respect to that component, as if it alone were the reference amount.
For example, if the index stock issuer merges into another company and each share of such index stock is converted into the right to receive two common shares of the surviving company and a specified amount of cash, the reference amount will be adjusted to consist of two common shares of the surviving company and the specified amount of cash for each share of index stock (adjusted proportionately for any partial share) comprising the reference amount before the adjustment. The calculation agent will adjust the common share component of the adjusted reference amount to reflect any later stock split or other event, including any later reorganization event, that affects the common shares of the surviving company, to the extent described in this subsection entitled “— Anti-dilution Adjustment Examples” as if the common shares of the surviving company were such index stock. In that event, the cash component will not be adjusted but will continue to be a component of the reference amount. Consequently, each component included in the reference amount will be adjusted on a sequential and cumulative basis for all relevant events requiring adjustment up to the relevant date.
The calculation agent will not make any adjustment for a reorganization event, however, unless the event becomes effective (or, if the event is a spin-off, unless the ex-dividend date for the spin-off occurs) after the trade date and on or before the applicable coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable.

|  1 | ADDITIONAL RISK FACTORS SPECIFIC TO YOUR NOTES |

 An investment in your notes is subject to the risks described below, as well as the risks and considerations described in the accompanying prospectus and in the accompanying prospectus supplement. You should carefully review these risks and considerations as well as the terms of the notes described herein and in the accompanying prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement. Your notes are a riskier investment than ordinary debt securities. Also, your notes are not equivalent to investing directly in the index stock. You should carefully consider whether the offered notes are appropriate given your particular circumstances.
 
Risks Related to Structure, Valuation and Secondary Market Sales

 
The Estimated Value of Your Notes At the Time the Terms of Your Notes Are Set On the Trade Date (as Determined By Reference to Pricing Models Used By GS&Co.) Is Less Than the Original Issue Price Of Your Notes

 The original issue price for your notes exceeds the estimated value of your notes as of the time the terms of your notes are set on the trade date, as determined by reference to GS&Co.’s pricing models and taking into account our credit spreads. Such estimated value on the trade date is set forth above under “Estimated Value of Your Notes”; after the trade date, the estimated value as determined by reference to these models will be affected by changes in market conditions, the creditworthiness of GS Finance Corp., as issuer, the creditworthiness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor, and other relevant factors. The price at which GS&Co. would initially buy or sell your notes (if GS&Co. makes a market, which it is not obligated to do), and the value that GS&Co. will initially use for account statements and otherwise, also exceeds the estimated value of your notes as determined by reference to these models. As agreed by GS&Co. and the distribution participants, this excess (i.e., the additional amount described under “Estimated Value of Your Notes”) will decline to zero on a straight line basis over the period from the date hereof through the applicable date set forth above under “Estimated Value of Your Notes”. Thereafter, if GS&Co. buys or sells your notes it will do so at prices that reflect the estimated value determined by reference to such pricing models at that time. The price at which GS&Co. will buy or sell your notes at any time also will reflect its then current bid and ask spread for similar sized trades of structured notes.
In estimating the value of your notes as of the time the terms of your notes are set on the trade date, as disclosed above under “Estimated Value of Your Notes”, GS&Co.’s pricing models consider certain variables, including principally our credit spreads, interest rates (forecasted, current and historical rates), volatility, price-sensitivity analysis and the time to maturity of the notes. These pricing models are proprietary and rely in part on certain assumptions about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, the actual value you would receive if you sold your notes in the secondary market, if any, to others may differ, perhaps materially, from the estimated value of your notes determined by reference to our models due to, among other things, any differences in pricing models or assumptions used by others. See “— The Market Value of Your Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors” below.
 The difference between the estimated value of your notes as of the time the terms of your notes are set on the trade date and the original issue price is a result of certain factors, including principally the underwriting discount and commissions, the expenses incurred in creating, documenting and marketing the notes, and an estimate of the difference between the amounts we pay to GS&Co. and the amounts GS&Co. pays to us in connection with your notes. We pay to GS&Co. amounts based on what we would pay to holders of a non-structured note with a similar maturity. In return for such payment, GS&Co. pays to us the amounts we owe under your notes.
 In addition to the factors discussed above, the value and quoted price of your notes at any time will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted. If GS&Co. makes a market in the notes, the price quoted by GS&Co. would reflect any changes in market conditions and other relevant factors, including any deterioration in our creditworthiness or perceived creditworthiness or the creditworthiness or perceived creditworthiness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. These changes may adversely affect the value of your notes, including the price you may receive for your notes in any market making transaction. To the extent that GS&Co. makes a market in the notes, the quoted price will reflect the estimated value
S-20


determined by reference to GS&Co.’s pricing models at that time, plus or minus its then current bid and ask spread for similar sized trades of structured notes (and subject to the declining excess amount described above).
 Furthermore, if you sell your notes, you will likely be charged a commission for secondary market transactions, or the price will likely reflect a dealer discount. This commission or discount will further reduce the proceeds you would receive for your notes in a secondary market sale.
 There is no assurance that GS&Co. or any other party will be willing to purchase your notes at any price and, in this regard, GS&Co. is not obligated to make a market in the notes. See “— Your Notes May Not Have an Active Trading Market” below.
 
The Notes Are Subject to the Credit Risk of the Issuer and the Guarantor

 Although the coupons (if any) and return on the notes will be based on the performance of the index stock, the payment of any amount due on the notes is subject to the credit risk of GS Finance Corp., as issuer of the notes, and the credit risk of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor of the notes. The notes are our unsecured obligations. Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the notes, and therefore investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Similarly, investors are dependent on the ability of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., as guarantor of the notes, to pay all amounts due on the notes, and therefore are also subject to its credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of its creditworthiness. See “Description of the Notes We May Offer — Information About Our Medium-Term Notes, Series F Program — How the Notes Rank Against Other Debt” on page S-5 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Description of Debt Securities We May Offer — Guarantee by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.” on page 67 of the accompanying prospectus.
 
You May Lose Your Entire Investment in the Notes

 You can lose your entire investment in the notes. Assuming your notes are not automatically called, the cash settlement amount on your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date will be based on the performance of the index stock as measured from the initial index stock price to the final index stock price on the determination date. If the final index stock price is less than the trigger buffer price, you will have a loss for each $1,000 of the face amount of your notes equal to the product of the index stock return times $1,000. Thus, you may lose your entire investment in the notes, which would include any premium to face amount you paid when you purchased the notes.
Also, the market price of your notes prior to a call payment date or the stated maturity date, as the case may be, may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your notes. Consequently, if you sell your notes before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the notes.
 
The Return on Your Notes May Change Significantly Despite Only a Small Change in the Price of the Index Stock

 If your notes are not automatically called and the final index stock price is less than the trigger buffer price, you will receive less than the face amount of your notes and you could lose all or a substantial portion of your investment in the notes. This means that while a decrease in the final index stock price to the trigger buffer price will not result in a loss of principal on the notes, a decrease in the final index stock price to less than the trigger buffer price will result in a loss of a significant portion of the face amount of the notes despite only a small change in the price of index stock.
 
You May Not Receive a Coupon on Any Coupon Payment Date

 If the closing price of the index stock on the related coupon observation date is less than the coupon trigger price, you will not receive a coupon payment on the applicable coupon payment date. If this occurs on every coupon observation date, the overall return you earn on your notes will be less than zero and such return will be less than you would have earned by investing in a note that bears interest at the prevailing market rate.
 You will only receive a coupon on a coupon payment date if the closing price of the index stock on the related coupon observation date is greater than or equal to the coupon trigger price. You should be aware
S-21


that, with respect to any prior coupon observation dates that did not result in the payment of a coupon, you will not be compensated for any opportunity cost implied by inflation and other factors relating to the time value of money. Further, there is no guarantee that you will receive any coupon payment with respect to the notes at any time and you may lose your entire investment in the notes.
 
Your Notes Are Subject to Automatic Redemption

 We will automatically call and redeem all, but not part, of your notes on a call payment date if, as measured on any call observation date, the closing price of the index stock is greater than or equal to the initial index stock price. Therefore, the term for your notes may be reduced. You will not receive any additional coupon payments after the notes are automatically called and you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the notes at a comparable return for a similar level of risk in the event the notes are automatically called prior to maturity. For the avoidance of doubt, if your notes are automatically called, no discounts, commissions or fees described herein will be rebated or reduced.
 
The Coupon Does Not Reflect the Actual Performance of the Index Stock from the Trade Date to Any Coupon Observation Date or from Coupon Observation Date to Coupon Observation Date

 The coupon for each quarterly coupon payment date is different from, and may be less than, a coupon determined based on the percentage difference of the closing prices of the index stock between the trade date and any coupon observation date or between two coupon observation dates. Accordingly, the coupons, if any, on the notes may be less than the return you could earn on another instrument linked to the index stock that pays coupons based on the performance of the index stock from the trade date to any coupon observation date or from coupon observation date to coupon observation date.
 
The Market Value of Your Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors

 When we refer to the market value of your notes, we mean the value that you could receive for your notes if you chose to sell them in the open market before the stated maturity date. A number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, will influence the market value of your notes, including:
 •the market price of the index stock to which your notes are linked;
 •the volatility – i.e., the frequency and magnitude of changes – in the market price of the index stock;
 •the dividend rate of the index stock;
 •economic, financial, regulatory, political, military, public health and other events that affect stock markets generally and the market segment of which the index stock is a part, and which may affect the market price of the index stock; 
 •interest rates and yield rates in the market;
 •the time remaining until your notes mature; and
 •our creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., whether actual or perceived, and including actual or anticipated upgrades or downgrades in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or changes in other credit measures.
 Without limiting the foregoing, the market value of your notes may be negatively impacted by increasing interest rates. Such adverse impact of increasing interest rates could be significantly enhanced in notes with longer-dated maturities, the market values of which are generally more sensitive to increasing interest rates.
 These factors, and many other factors, will influence the price you will receive if you sell your notes before maturity, including the price you may receive for your notes in any market making transaction. If you sell your notes before maturity, you may receive less than the face amount of your notes.
 You cannot predict the future performance of the index stock based on its historical performance. The actual performance of the index stock over the life of the offered notes, the cash settlement amount paid on a call payment date or the stated maturity date, as the case may be, as well as the coupon payable, if any, on each coupon payment date, may bear little or no relation to the historical closing prices of the index stock or to the hypothetical examples shown elsewhere in this prospectus supplement.
 S-22



Your Notes May Not Have an Active Trading Market

 Your notes will not be listed or displayed on any securities exchange or included in any interdealer market quotation system, and there may be little or no secondary market for your notes. Even if a secondary market for your notes develops, it may not provide significant liquidity and we expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result, the difference between bid and asked prices for your notes in any secondary market could be substantial.
 
If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected

 The cash settlement amount you will be paid for your notes on the stated maturity date, if any, or the amount you will be paid on a call payment date will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the face amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in such notes held to a call payment date or the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at face amount. If you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount and hold them to a call payment date or the stated maturity date, the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount or a discount to face amount.

If the Market Price of the Index Stock Changes, the Market Value of Your Notes May Not Change in the Same Manner

The price of your notes may move differently than the performance of the index stock. Changes in the market price of the index stock may not result in a comparable change in the market value of your notes. Even if the closing price of the index stock is greater than or equal to the trigger buffer price during some portion of the life of the notes, the market value of your notes may not reflect this. We discuss some of the reasons for this disparity under “— The Market Value of Your Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors” above.
 
We Will Not Hold Shares of the Index Stock for Your Benefit

 The indenture governing your note does not contain any restriction on our ability or the ability of any of our affiliates to sell, pledge or otherwise convey a share or shares of the index stock acquired by us or them. Neither we nor our affiliates will pledge or otherwise hold shares of the index stock for your benefit in order to enable you to exchange your note for shares under any circumstances. Consequently, in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation, any shares of the index stock owned by us will be subject to the claims of our creditors generally and will not be available for your benefit specifically.

You Have No Shareholder Rights or Rights to Receive Any Index Stock

 Investing in your notes will not make you a holder of the index stock. Neither you nor any other holder or owner of your notes will have any rights with respect to the index stock, including any voting rights, any right to receive dividends or other distributions, any rights to make a claim against the index stock, or any other rights of a holder of any shares of the index stock. Your notes will be paid in cash and you will have no right to receive delivery of any shares of the index stock.

In Some Circumstances, the Payment You Receive On the Notes May Be Based On the Securities of Another Company and Not the Issuer of the Index Stock

 Following certain corporate events relating to the index stock where its issuer is not the surviving entity, the amount you receive at maturity may be based on the securities of a successor to the index stock issuer or any cash or any other assets distributed to holders of shares of the index stock in such corporate event. The occurrence of these corporate events and the consequent adjustments may materially and adversely affect the value of the notes. We describe the specific corporate events that can lead to these adjustments and the procedures for selecting distribution property (as described above) under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments”.
S-23



Past Index Stock Performance is No Guide to Future Performance

 The actual performance of the index stock over the life of the notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity or on any coupon payment date, as applicable, if any, may bear little relation to the historical closing prices of the index stock or to the hypothetical examples set forth elsewhere in this prospectus supplement. We cannot predict the future performance of the index stock.

As Calculation Agent, GS&Co. Will Have the Authority to Make Determinations that Could Affect the Value of Your Notes

 As calculation agent for your notes, GS&Co. will have discretion in making certain determinations that affect your notes, including determining: the closing price of the index stock on any coupon observation date, which we will use to determine the coupon, if any, we will pay on any applicable coupon payment date; whether your notes will be automatically called; the final index stock price on the determination date, which we will use to determine the amount we must pay on the stated maturity date; whether to postpone a coupon observation date or the determination date because of a market disruption event or a non-trading day; when and how to make anti-dilution adjustments to the index stock price; and the coupon observation dates and the coupon payment dates; the call observation dates and the call payment dates; and the stated maturity date. See “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” above. The exercise of this discretion by GS&Co. could adversely affect the value of your notes and may present GS&Co. with a conflict of interest. We may change the calculation agent at any time without notice and GS&Co. may resign as calculation agent at any time upon 60 days' written notice to us.
 
The Calculation Agent Can Postpone a Coupon Observation Date or the Determination Date, as the Case May Be, If a Market Disruption Event or a Non-Trading Day Occurs or is Continuing

 If the calculation agent determines that, on a date that would otherwise be a coupon observation date or the determination date, a market disruption event has occurred or is continuing or that day is not a trading day, such coupon observation date or the determination date will be postponed as provided under “Terms and Conditions — Coupon observation dates” and “Terms and Conditions — Determination date”, as applicable. In no case, however, will the coupon observation date or the determination date be postponed to a date later than the corresponding originally scheduled coupon payment date or the originally scheduled stated maturity date, as applicable, or if the corresponding originally scheduled coupon payment date or the originally scheduled stated maturity date is not a business day, later than the first business day after the corresponding originally scheduled coupon payment date or the originally scheduled stated maturity date. Moreover, if a coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, is postponed to the last possible day, but the market disruption event has not ceased by that day or that day is not a trading day, that day will nevertheless be the coupon observation date or the determination date, as applicable, for the corresponding coupon payment date or the stated maturity date. In such a case, the calculation agent will determine the applicable closing price of the index stock or final index stock price for such coupon observation date or the determination date based on the procedures described under “Terms and Conditions — Consequences of a market disruption event or a non-trading day” above.
 
There is No Affiliation Between the Index Stock Issuer and Us

 Goldman Sachs is not affiliated with the index stock issuer. As discussed above, however, we or our affiliates may currently or from time to time in the future engage in business with the index stock issuer. Neither we nor any of our affiliates have participated in the preparation of any publicly available information or made any “due diligence” investigation or inquiry with respect to the index stock issuer. You, as an investor in your note, should make your own investigation into the index stock issuer.
The index stock issuer is not involved in this offering of your notes in any way and does not have any obligation of any sort with respect to your notes. Thus, the index stock issuer does not have any obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason, including in taking or not taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your notes.

You Have Limited Anti-Dilution Protection

 GS&Co., as calculation agent for your note, will adjust the index stock price for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, extraordinary dividends, issuances of transferable rights and warrants,
S-24


reorganization events, and other events that affect the index stock issuer’s, or any distribution property issuer’s, capital structure, but only in the situations we describe in “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments” above. The calculation agent will not be required to make an adjustment for every corporate event that may affect the index stock. For example, the calculation agent will not adjust the index stock price for events such as an offering of the index stock for cash by the index stock issuer, a tender or exchange offer for the index stock at a premium to its then-current market price by the index stock issuer or a tender or exchange offer for less than all the outstanding shares of the index stock by a third party. In addition, the calculation agent will not adjust the reference amount for regular cash dividends. Furthermore, the calculation agent will determine in its sole discretion whether to make adjustments with respect to corporate or other events as described under “Terms and Conditions — Anti-dilution adjustments — Reorganization events” above. Those events or other actions by the index stock issuer or a third party may nevertheless adversely affect the market price of one share of the index stock and, therefore, adversely affect the market value of your note. The index stock issuer or a third party could make an offering or a tender or exchange offer, or the index stock issuer could take any other action, that adversely affects the market price of the index stock and the market value of your note but does not result in an anti-dilution adjustment for your benefit.

We May Sell an Additional Aggregate Face Amount of the Notes at a Different Issue Price

 At our sole option, we may decide to sell an additional aggregate face amount of the notes subsequent to the date of this prospectus supplement. The issue price of the notes in the subsequent sale may differ substantially (higher or lower) from the issue price you paid as provided on the cover of this prospectus supplement.
 
Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest

 
Hedging Activities by Goldman Sachs or Our Distributors May Negatively Impact Investors in the Notes and Cause Our Interests and Those of Our Clients and Counterparties to be Contrary to Those of Investors in the Notes

 Goldman Sachs has hedged or expects to hedge our obligations under the notes by purchasing shares of the index stock, listed or over-the-counter options, futures and/or other instruments linked to the index stock. Goldman Sachs also expects to adjust the hedge by, among other things, purchasing or selling any of the foregoing, and perhaps other instruments linked to the index stock, at any time and from time to time, and to unwind the hedge by selling any of the foregoing on or before the determination date for your notes. Alternatively, Goldman Sachs may hedge all or part of our obligations under the notes with unaffiliated distributors of the notes which we expect will undertake similar market activity. Goldman Sachs may also enter into, adjust and unwind hedging transactions relating to other notes whose returns are linked to changes in the price of the index stock.
In addition to entering into such transactions itself, or distributors entering into such transactions, Goldman Sachs may structure such transactions for its clients or counterparties, or otherwise advise or assist clients or counterparties in entering into such transactions. These activities may be undertaken to achieve a variety of objectives, including: permitting other purchasers of the notes or other securities to hedge their investment in whole or in part; facilitating transactions for other clients or counterparties that may have business objectives or investment strategies that are inconsistent with or contrary to those of investors in the notes; hedging the exposure of Goldman Sachs to the notes including any interest in the notes that it reacquires or retains as part of the offering process, through its market-making activities or otherwise; enabling Goldman Sachs to comply with its internal risk limits or otherwise manage firmwide, business unit or product risk; and/or enabling Goldman Sachs to take directional views as to relevant markets on behalf of itself or its clients or counterparties that are inconsistent with or contrary to the views and objectives of the investors in the notes.
Any of these hedging or other activities may adversely affect the prices of the index stock — directly or indirectly— and therefore the market value of your notes and the amount we will pay on your notes, if any. In addition, you should expect that these transactions will cause Goldman Sachs or its clients, counterparties or distributors to have economic interests and incentives that do not align with, and that may be directly contrary to, those of an investor in the notes. Neither Goldman Sachs nor any distributor will have any obligation to take, refrain from taking or cease taking any action with respect to these
S-25


transactions based on the potential effect on an investor in the notes, and may receive substantial returns on hedging or other activities while the value of your notes declines. In addition, if the distributor from which you purchase notes is to conduct hedging activities in connection with the notes, that distributor may otherwise profit in connection with such hedging activities and such profit, if any, will be in addition to the compensation that the distributor receives for the sale of the notes to you. You should be aware that the potential to earn fees in connection with hedging activities may create a further incentive for the distributor to sell the notes to you in addition to the compensation they would receive for the sale of the notes.
 
Goldman Sachs’ Trading and Investment Activities for its Own Account or for its Clients, Could Negatively Impact Investors in the Notes

 Goldman Sachs is a global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. As such, it acts as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager, investment advisor, market maker, trader, prime broker and lender. In those and other capacities, Goldman Sachs purchases, sells or holds a broad array of investments, actively trades securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps, indices, baskets and other financial instruments and products for its own account or for the accounts of its customers, and will have other direct or indirect interests, in the global fixed income, currency, commodity, equity, bank loan and other markets. Any of Goldman Sachs’ financial market activities may, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on the market for your notes, and you should expect that the interests of Goldman Sachs or its clients or counterparties will at times be adverse to those of investors in the notes.
 Goldman Sachs regularly offers a wide array of securities, financial instruments and other products into the marketplace, including existing or new products that are similar to your notes, or similar or linked to the index stock. Investors in the notes should expect that Goldman Sachs will offer securities, financial instruments, and other products that will compete with the notes for liquidity, research coverage or otherwise.
 
Goldman Sachs’ Market-Making Activities Could Negatively Impact Investors in the Notes

 Goldman Sachs actively makes markets in and trades financial instruments for its own account and for the accounts of customers. These financial instruments include debt and equity securities, currencies, commodities, bank loans, indices, baskets and other products. Goldman Sachs’ activities include, among other things, executing large block trades and taking long and short positions directly and indirectly, through derivative instruments or otherwise. The securities and instruments in which Goldman Sachs takes positions, or expects to take positions, include securities and instruments of the index stock, securities and instruments similar to or linked to the foregoing or the currencies in which they are denominated. Market making is an activity where Goldman Sachs buys and sells on behalf of customers, or for its own account, to satisfy the expected demand of customers. By its nature, market making involves facilitating transactions among market participants that have differing views of securities and instruments. As a result, you should expect that Goldman Sachs will take positions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of investors in the notes.
 If Goldman Sachs becomes a holder of the index stock in its capacity as a market-maker or otherwise, any actions that it takes in its capacity as securityholder, including voting or provision of consents, will not necessarily be aligned with, and may be inconsistent with, the interests of investors in the notes.
 
You Should Expect That Goldman Sachs Personnel Will Take Research Positions, or Otherwise Make Recommendations, Provide Investment Advice or Market Color or Encourage Trading Strategies That Might Negatively Impact Investors in the Notes

 Goldman Sachs and its personnel, including its sales and trading, investment research and investment management personnel, regularly make investment recommendations, provide market color or trading ideas, or publish or express independent views in respect of a wide range of markets, issuers, securities and instruments. They regularly implement, or recommend to clients that they implement, various investment strategies relating to these markets, issuers, securities and instruments. These strategies include, for example, buying or selling credit protection against a default or other event involving an issuer
S-26


or financial instrument. Any of these recommendations and views may be negative with respect to the index stock or other securities or instruments similar to or linked to the foregoing or result in trading strategies that have a negative impact on the market for any such securities or instruments, particularly in illiquid markets. In addition, you should expect that personnel in the trading and investing businesses of Goldman Sachs will have or develop independent views of the index stock, the relevant industry or other market trends, which may not be aligned with the views and objectives of investors in the notes.
 
Goldman Sachs Regularly Provides Services to, or Otherwise Has Business Relationships with, a Broad Client Base, Which May Include the Issuer of the Index Stock or Other Entities That Are Involved in the Transaction

 Goldman Sachs regularly provides financial advisory, investment advisory and transactional services to a substantial and diversified client base, and you should assume that Goldman Sachs will, at present or in the future, provide such services or otherwise engage in transactions with, among others, the issuer of the index stock, or transact in securities or instruments or with parties that are directly or indirectly related to the foregoing. These services could include making loans to or equity investments in those companies, providing financial advisory or other investment banking services, or issuing research reports. You should expect that Goldman Sachs, in providing such services, engaging in such transactions, or acting for its own account, may take actions that have direct or indirect effects on the index stock and that such actions could be adverse to the interests of investors in the notes. In addition, in connection with these activities, certain Goldman Sachs personnel may have access to confidential material non-public information about these parties that would not be disclosed to Goldman Sachs employees that were not working on such transactions as Goldman Sachs has established internal information barriers that are designed to preserve the confidentiality of non-public information. Therefore, any such confidential material non-public information would not be shared with Goldman Sachs employees involved in structuring, selling or making markets in the notes or with investors in the notes.
In this offering, as well as in all other circumstances in which Goldman Sachs receives any fees or other compensation in any form relating to services provided to or transactions with any other party, no accounting, offset or payment in respect of the notes will be required or made; Goldman Sachs will be entitled to retain all such fees and other amounts, and no fees or other compensation payable by any party or indirectly by holders of the notes will be reduced by reason of receipt by Goldman Sachs of any such other fees or other amounts.
 
The Offering of the Notes May Reduce an Existing Exposure of Goldman Sachs or Facilitate a Transaction or Position That Serves the Objectives of Goldman Sachs or Other Parties

 A completed offering may reduce Goldman Sachs’ existing exposure to the index stock, securities and instruments similar to or linked to the foregoing or the currencies in which they are denominated, including exposure gained through hedging transactions in anticipation of this offering. An offering of notes will effectively transfer a portion of Goldman Sachs’ exposure (and indirectly transfer the exposure of Goldman Sachs’ hedging or other counterparties) to investors in the notes.
 The terms of the offering (including the selection of the index stock, and the establishment of other transaction terms) may have been selected in order to serve the investment or other objectives of Goldman Sachs or another client or counterparty of Goldman Sachs. In such a case, Goldman Sachs would typically receive the input of other parties that are involved in or otherwise have an interest in the offering, transactions hedged by the offering, or related transactions. The incentives of these other parties would normally differ from and in many cases be contrary to those of investors in the notes.
 
Other Investors in the Notes May Not Have the Same Interests as You

 Other investors in the notes are not required to take into account the interests of any other investor in exercising remedies or voting or other rights in their capacity as securityholders or in making requests or recommendations to Goldman Sachs as to the establishment of other transaction terms. The interests of other investors may, in some circumstances, be adverse to your interests. For example, certain investors may take short positions (directly or indirectly through derivative transactions) on assets that are the same or similar to your notes, index stock or other similar securities, which may adversely impact the market for or value of your notes.
 S-27



Risks Related to Tax

 
Certain Considerations for Insurance Companies and Employee Benefit Plans

 Any insurance company or fiduciary of a pension plan or other employee benefit plan that is subject to the prohibited transaction rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which we call “ERISA”, or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including an IRA or a Keogh plan (or a governmental plan to which similar prohibitions apply), and that is considering purchasing the offered notes with the assets of the insurance company or the assets of such a plan, should consult with its counsel regarding whether the purchase or holding of the offered notes could become a “prohibited transaction” under ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any substantially similar prohibition in light of the representations a purchaser or holder in any of the above categories is deemed to make by purchasing and holding the offered notes. This is discussed in more detail under “Employee Retirement Income Security Act” below.
 
The Tax Consequences of an Investment in Your Notes Are Uncertain

 The tax consequences of an investment in your notes are uncertain, both as to the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of your notes.
The Internal Revenue Service announced on December 7, 2007 that it is considering issuing guidance regarding the tax treatment of an instrument such as your notes, and any such guidance could adversely affect the value and the tax treatment of your notes. Among other things, the Internal Revenue Service may decide to require the holders to accrue ordinary income on a current basis and recognize ordinary income on payment at maturity, and could subject non-U.S. investors to withholding tax. Furthermore, in 2007, legislation was introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have required holders that acquired instruments such as your notes after the bill was enacted to accrue interest income over the term of such instruments even though there may be no interest payments over the term of such instruments. It is not possible to predict whether a similar or identical bill will be enacted in the future, or whether any such bill would affect the tax treatment of your notes. We describe these developments in more detail under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences – United States Holders – Possible Change in Law” below. You should consult your tax advisor about this matter. Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, GS Finance Corp. intends to continue treating the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with the treatment described under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” below unless and until such time as Congress, the Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service determine that some other treatment is more appropriate. Please also consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax and any other applicable tax consequences to you of owning your notes in your particular circumstances.
 
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Withholding May Apply to Payments on Your Notes, Including as a Result of the Failure of the Bank or Broker Through Which You Hold the Notes to Provide Information to Tax Authorities


 Please see the discussion under “United States Taxation — Taxation of Debt Securities — Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus for a description of the applicability of FATCA to payments made on your notes.


S-28



Use of Proceeds

 We intend to lend the net proceeds from the sale of the offered notes to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or its affiliates. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. expects to use the proceeds from such loans for the purposes we describe in the accompanying prospectus under “Use of Proceeds”. We or our affiliates may also use those proceeds in transactions intended to hedge our obligations under the offered notes as described below.


Hedging

 In anticipation of the sale of the offered notes, we and/or our affiliates have entered into or expect to enter into hedging transactions involving purchases of the index stock and listed or over-the-counter options, futures or other instruments linked to the index stock on or before the trade date. In addition, from time to time, we and/or our affiliates expect to enter into additional hedging transactions and to unwind those we have entered into, in connection with the offered notes and perhaps in connection with other notes we issue, some of which may have returns linked to index stock. Consequently, with regard to your notes, from time to time, we and/or our affiliates:
•expect to acquire, or dispose of positions in listed or over-the-counter options, futures or other instruments linked to the index stock, 
 •may take or dispose of positions in the securities of the index stock issuer itself, 
 •may take or dispose of positions in listed or over-the-counter options or other instruments based on indices designed to track the performance of the New York Stock Exchange or other components of the U.S. equity market, and/ or 
 •may take short positions in the index stock or other securities of the kind described above — i.e., we and/or our affiliates may sell securities of the kind that we do not own or that we borrow for delivery to purchaser. 
 We and/or our affiliates may also acquire a long or short position in securities similar to your notes from time to time and may, in our or their sole discretion, hold or resell those securities.
In the future, we and/or our affiliates expect to close out hedge positions relating to the offered notes and perhaps relating to other notes with returns linked to the index stock. We expect these steps to involve sales of instruments linked to the index stock on or shortly before the determination date. These steps may also involve sales and/or purchases of the index stock, or listed or over-the-counter options, futures or other instruments linked to the index stock or indices designed to track the performance of the New York Stock Exchange or other components of the U.S. equity market.

The hedging activity discussed above may adversely affect the market value of your notes from time to time and the amount we will pay on your notes at maturity. See “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” above for a discussion of these adverse effects.
S-29



The Index stock

 The index stock issuer is Carnival Corporation. According to publicly available information, Carnival Corporation is a leisure travel company.

Where Information About the Index Stock Issuer Can Be Obtained

The index stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act are required to file financial and other information specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) periodically. Information filed by the index stock issuer with the SEC electronically can be reviewed through a web site maintained by the SEC. The address of the SEC’s web site is sec.gov. Information filed with the SEC by the index stock issuer under the Exchange Act can be located by referencing its SEC file number 001-09610.
 Information about the index stock issuer may also be obtained from other sources such as press releases, newspaper articles and other publicly available documents.
We do not make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any materials referred to above, including any filings made by the index stock issuer with the SEC.

We Obtained the Information About the Index Stock Issuer From the Index Stock Issuer’s Public Filings

This prospectus supplement relates only to your note and does not relate to the index stock or other securities of the index stock issuer. We have derived all information about the index stock issuer in this prospectus supplement from the publicly available information referred to in the preceding subsection. We have not participated in the preparation of any of those documents or made any “due diligence” investigation or inquiry with respect to the index stock issuer in connection with the offering of your note. Furthermore, we do not know whether all events occurring before the date of this prospectus supplement — including events that would affect the accuracy or completeness of the publicly available documents referred to above and the trading price of shares of the index stock — have been publicly disclosed. Subsequent disclosure of any events of this kind or the disclosure of or failure to disclose material future events concerning the index stock issuer could affect the value you will receive at maturity and, therefore, the market value of your note.
Neither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the index stock.
We or any of our affiliates may currently or from time to time engage in business with the index stock issuer, including making loans to or equity investments in the index stock issuer or providing advisory services to the index stock issuer, including merger and acquisition advisory services. In the course of that business, we or any of our affiliates may acquire non-public information about the index stock issuer and, in addition, one or more of our affiliates may publish research reports about the index stock issuer. As an investor in a note, you should undertake such independent investigation of the index stock issuer as in your judgment is appropriate to make an informed decision with respect to an investment in a note.

Historical Closing Prices of the Index Stock

 The closing prices of the index stock have fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. In particular, the index stock has recently experienced extreme and unusual volatility. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing prices of the index stock during the period shown below is not an indication that the index stock is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the life of your notes.
 You should not take the historical prices of the index stock as an indication of the future performance of the index stock, including because of the recent volatility described above. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the index stock will result in your receiving any coupon payments or receiving the outstanding face amount of your notes on the stated maturity date.
 
Neither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the index stock. Before investing in the offered notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the relevant prices of the index stock between the date of this prospectus supplement and the date of your purchase of the notes and, given the recent volatility described above, you should pay particular attention to recent prices of the index stock. The actual performance of the index stock over the life of the offered notes, as well as the cash settlement amount at maturity, may bear little relation to the historical prices shown below.
 The graph below shows the daily historical closing prices of the index stock from January 1, 2019 through July 30, 2024, adjusted for corporate events, if applicable. As a result, the following graph does not reflect the global financial crisis which began in 2008, which had a materially negative impact on the price of most equity securities. We obtained the closing prices in the graph below from Bloomberg Financial Services, without independent verification.

Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

 The following section supplements the discussion of U.S. federal income taxation in the accompanying prospectus.
 The following section is the opinion of Sidley Austin llp, counsel to GS Finance Corp. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. In addition, it is the opinion of Sidley Austin llp that the characterization of the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes that will be required under the terms of the notes, as discussed below, is a reasonable interpretation of current law.
 This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a class of holders subject to special rules, such as:
 •a dealer in securities or currencies;
 •a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities holdings;
 •a bank;
 •a life insurance company;
 •a regulated investment company;
 •an accrual method taxpayer subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of its use of financial statements;
 •a tax exempt organization;
 •a partnership;
 •a person that owns a note as a hedge or that is hedged against interest rate risks;
 •a person that owns a note as part of a straddle or conversion transaction for tax purposes; or
 •a United States holder (as defined below) whose functional currency for tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar.
 Although this section is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, published rulings and court decisions, all as currently in effect, no statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how your notes should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and as a result, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in your notes are uncertain. Moreover, these laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.
 You should consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax and other tax consequences of your investment in the notes, including the application of state, local or other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.
 
United States Holders

 This section applies to you only if you are a United States holder that holds your notes as a capital asset for tax purposes. You are a United States holder if you are a beneficial owner of a note and you are:

 •a citizen or resident of the United States;

 •a domestic corporation;
 S-32



•an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
 •a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more United States persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
 Tax Treatment. You will be obligated pursuant to the terms of the notes — in the absence of a change in law, an administrative determination or a judicial ruling to the contrary — to characterize your notes for all tax purposes as income-bearing pre-paid derivative contracts in respect of the index stock. Except as otherwise stated below, the discussion below assumes that the notes will be so treated.
 Coupon payments that you receive should be included in ordinary income at the time you receive the payment or when the payment accrues, in accordance with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 Upon the sale, exchange, redemption or maturity of your notes, you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange, redemption or maturity (excluding any amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid coupon payments, which will be taxable as described above) and your tax basis in your notes. Your tax basis in your notes will generally be equal to the amount that you paid for the notes. Such capital gain or loss should generally be short-term capital gain or loss if you hold the notes for one year or less, and should be long-term capital gain or loss if you hold the notes for more than one year. Short-term capital gains are generally subject to tax at the marginal tax rates applicable to ordinary income.
 We will not attempt to ascertain whether the index stock issuer would be treated as a “passive foreign investment company” (“PFIC”), within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Internal Revenue Code. If the index stock issuer were so treated, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could possibly apply to a United States holder. You should refer to information filed with the SEC with respect to the index stock issuer and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you, if any, if the index stock issuer is or becomes a PFIC.
 No statutory, judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how your notes should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the notes are uncertain and alternative characterizations are possible. Accordingly, we urge you to consult your tax advisor in determining the tax consequences of an investment in your notes in your particular circumstances, including the application of state, local or other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.
 Alternative Treatments. There is no judicial or administrative authority discussing how your notes should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, the Internal Revenue Service might assert that a treatment other than that described above is more appropriate. For example, the Internal Revenue Service could treat your notes as a single debt instrument subject to special rules governing contingent payment debt instruments.
 Under those rules, the amount of interest you are required to take into account for each accrual period would be determined by constructing a projected payment schedule for the notes and applying rules similar to those for accruing original issue discount on a hypothetical noncontingent debt instrument with that projected payment schedule. This method is applied by first determining the comparable yield — i.e., the yield at which we would issue a noncontingent fixed rate debt instrument with terms and conditions similar to your notes — and then determining a payment schedule as of the applicable original issue date that would produce the comparable yield. These rules may have the effect of requiring you to include interest in income in respect of your notes prior to your receipt of cash attributable to that income.
 If the rules governing contingent payment debt instruments apply, any gain you recognize upon the sale, exchange, redemption or maturity of your notes would be treated as ordinary interest income. Any loss
S-33



you recognize at that time would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of interest you included as income in the current or previous taxable years in respect of your notes, and, thereafter, as capital loss.
 If the rules governing contingent payment debt instruments apply, special rules would apply to persons who purchase a note at other than the adjusted issue price as determined for tax purposes.
It is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could assert that your notes should generally be characterized as described above, except that (1) the gain you recognize upon the sale, exchange, redemption or maturity of your notes should be treated as ordinary income or (2) you should not include the coupon payments in income as you receive them but instead you should reduce your basis in your notes by the amount of coupon payments that you receive. It is also possible that the Internal Revenue Service could seek to characterize your notes in a manner that results in tax consequences to you different from those described above.
It is also possible that the Internal Revenue Service could seek to characterize your notes as notional principal contracts. It is also possible that the coupon payments would not be treated as either ordinary income or interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but instead would be treated in some other manner.
You should consult your tax advisor as to possible alternative characterizations of your notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Possible Change in Law

 In 2007, legislation was introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have required holders that acquired instruments such as your notes after the bill was enacted to accrue interest income over the term of such instruments even though there may be no interest payments over the term of such instruments. It is not possible to predict whether a similar or identical bill will be enacted in the future, or whether any such bill would affect the tax treatment of your notes.
 In addition, on December 7, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service released a notice stating that the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department are actively considering issuing guidance regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of an instrument such as the offered notes including whether the holders should be required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis and whether gain or loss should be ordinary or capital. It is not possible to determine what guidance they will ultimately issue, if any. It is possible, however, that under such guidance, holders of the notes will ultimately be required to accrue income currently and this could be applied on a retroactive basis. The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department are also considering other relevant issues, including whether foreign holders of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals, and whether the special “constructive ownership rules” of Section 1260 of the Internal Revenue Code might be applied to such instruments. Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, GS Finance Corp. intends to continue treating the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with the treatment described above unless and until such time as Congress, the Treasury Department or the Internal Revenue Service determine that some other treatment is more appropriate.
 It is impossible to predict what any such legislation or administrative or regulatory guidance might provide, and whether the effective date of any legislation or guidance will affect notes that were issued before the date that such legislation or guidance is issued. You are urged to consult your tax advisor as to the possibility that any legislative or administrative action may adversely affect the tax treatment of your notes.
 
Non-United States Holders

 This section applies to you only if you are a non-United States holder. You are a non-United States holder if you are the beneficial owner of the notes and are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
 •a nonresident alien individual;
 S-34



•a foreign corporation; or
 •an estate or trust that in either case is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis on income or gain from the notes.
 Because the U.S. federal income tax treatment (including the applicability of withholding) of the coupon payments on the notes is uncertain, in the absence of further guidance, we intend to withhold on the coupon payments made to you at a 30% rate or at a lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty under an “other income” or similar provision. We will not make payments of any additional amounts. To claim a reduced treaty rate for withholding, you generally must provide a valid Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E or an acceptable substitute form upon which you certify, under penalty of perjury, your status as a non-United States holder and your entitlement to the lower treaty rate. Payments will be made to you at a reduced treaty rate of withholding only if such reduced treaty rate would apply to any possible characterization of the payments (including, for example, if the coupon payments were characterized as contract fees). Withholding also may not apply to coupon payments made to you if: (i) the coupon payments are “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States and are includable in your gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) the coupon payments are attributable to a permanent establishment that you maintain in the United States, if required by an applicable tax treaty, and (iii) you comply with the requisite certification requirements (generally, by providing an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI). If you are eligible for a reduced rate of United States withholding tax, you may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld in excess of that rate by filing a refund claim with the Internal Revenue Service.
 “Effectively connected” payments includable in your United States gross income are generally taxed at rates applicable to United States citizens, resident aliens, and domestic corporations; if you are a corporate non-United States holder, “effectively connected” payments may be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” under certain circumstances.
 You will also be subject to generally applicable information reporting and backup withholding requirements with respect to payments on your notes and, notwithstanding that we do not intend to treat the notes as debt for tax purposes, we intend to backup withhold on such payments with respect to your notes unless you comply with the requirements necessary to avoid backup withholding on debt instruments (in which case you will not be subject to such backup withholding) as set forth under “United States Taxation – Taxation of Debt Securities – Non-United States Holders” in the accompanying prospectus.
Furthermore, on December 7, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service released Notice 2008-2 soliciting comments from the public on various issues, including whether instruments such as your notes should be subject to withholding. It is therefore possible that rules will be issued in the future, possibly with retroactive effect, that would cause payments on your notes to be subject to withholding, even if you comply with certification requirements as to your foreign status.
 As discussed above, alternative characterizations of the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes are possible. Should an alternative characterization of the notes, by reason of a change or clarification of the law, by regulation or otherwise, cause payments with respect to the notes to become subject to withholding tax, we will withhold tax at the applicable statutory rate and we will not make payments of any additional amounts. Prospective non-United States holders of the notes should consult their tax advisors in this regard.
 We will not attempt to ascertain whether the index stock issuer would be treated as a “United States real property holding corporation” (“USRPHC”), within the meaning of Section 897 of the Internal Revenue Code. If the index stock issuer were so treated, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could possibly apply to a non-United States holder. You should refer to information filed with the SEC with
S-35



respect to the index stock issuer and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you, if any, if the index stock issuer is or becomes a USRPHC.
 In addition, the Treasury Department has issued regulations under which amounts paid or deemed paid on certain financial instruments (“871(m) financial instruments”) that are treated as attributable to U.S.-source dividends could be treated, in whole or in part depending on the circumstances, as a “dividend equivalent” payment that is subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable treaty), which in the case of any coupon payments and any amounts you receive upon the sale, exchange, redemption or maturity of your notes, could be collected via withholding. If these regulations were to apply to the notes, we may be required to withhold such taxes if any U.S.-source dividends are paid on the index stock during the term of the notes. We could also require you to make certifications (e.g., an applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8) prior to any coupon payment or the maturity of the notes in order to avoid or minimize withholding obligations, and we could withhold accordingly (subject to your potential right to claim a refund from the Internal Revenue Service) if such certifications were not received or were not satisfactory. If withholding was required, we would not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld. These regulations generally will apply to 871(m) financial instruments (or a combination of financial instruments treated as having been entered into in connection with each other) issued (or significantly modified and treated as retired and reissued) on or after January 1, 2027, but will also apply to certain 871(m) financial instruments (or a combination of financial instruments treated as having been entered into in connection with each other) that have a delta (as defined in the applicable Treasury regulations) of one and are issued (or significantly modified and treated as retired and reissued) on or after January 1, 2017. In addition, these regulations will not apply to financial instruments that reference a “qualified index” (as defined in the regulations). We have determined that, as of the issue date of your notes, your notes will not be subject to withholding under these rules. In certain limited circumstances, however, you should be aware that it is possible for non-United States holders to be liable for tax under these rules with respect to a combination of transactions treated as having been entered into in connection with each other even when no withholding is required. You should consult your tax advisor concerning these regulations, subsequent official guidance and regarding any other possible alternative characterizations of your notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Withholding

 Pursuant to Treasury regulations, Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) withholding (as described in “United States Taxation—Taxation of Debt Securities—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus) will generally apply to obligations that are issued on or after July 1, 2014; therefore, the notes will generally be subject to the FATCA withholding rules.

|  1 | EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT |

 
This section is only relevant to you if you are an insurance company or the fiduciary of a pension plan or an employee benefit plan (including a governmental plan, an IRA or a Keogh Plan) proposing to invest in the notes.
 The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), prohibit certain transactions (“prohibited transactions”) involving the assets of an employee benefit plan that is subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (including individual retirement accounts, Keogh plans and other plans described in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code) (a “Plan”) and certain persons who are “parties in interest” (within the meaning of ERISA) or “disqualified persons” (within the meaning of the Code) with respect to the Plan; governmental plans may be subject to similar prohibitions unless an exemption applies to the transaction. The assets of a Plan may include assets held in the general account of an insurance company that are deemed “plan assets” under ERISA or assets of certain investment vehicles in which the Plan invests. Each of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and certain of its affiliates may be considered a “party in interest” or a “disqualified person” with respect to many Plans, and, accordingly, prohibited transactions may arise if the notes are acquired by or on behalf of a Plan unless those notes are acquired and held pursuant to an available exemption. In general, available exemptions include: transactions effected on behalf of that Plan by a “qualified professional asset manager” (prohibited transaction exemption 84-14) or an “in-house asset manager” (prohibited transaction exemption 96-23), transactions involving insurance company general accounts (prohibited transaction exemption 95-60), transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts (prohibited transaction exemption 90‑1), transactions involving bank collective investment funds (prohibited transaction exemption 91-38) and transactions with service providers under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code where the Plan receives no less and pays no more than “adequate consideration” (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code). The person making the decision on behalf of a Plan or a governmental plan shall be deemed, on behalf of itself and the plan, by purchasing and holding the notes, or exercising any rights related thereto, to represent that (a) the plan will receive no less and pay no more than “adequate consideration” (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) in connection with the purchase and holding of the notes, (b) none of the purchase, holding or disposition of the notes or the exercise of any rights related to the notes will result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code (or, with respect to a governmental plan, under any similar applicable law or regulation), and (c) neither The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. nor any of its affiliates is a “fiduciary” (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) or, with respect to a governmental plan, under any similar applicable law or regulation) with respect to the purchaser or holder in connection with such person's acquisition, disposition or holding of the notes, or as a result of any exercise by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. or any of its affiliates of any rights in connection with the notes, and neither The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. nor any of its affiliates has provided investment advice in connection with such person’s acquisition, disposition or holding of the notes.

If you are an insurance company or the fiduciary of a pension plan or an employee benefit plan (including a governmental plan, an IRA or a Keogh plan), and propose to invest in the notes, you should consult your legal counsel.

|  1 | SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION |

 GS Finance Corp. will sell to GS&Co., and GS&Co. will purchase from GS Finance Corp., the aggregate face amount of the offered notes specified on the front cover of this prospectus supplement. GS&Co. proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the original issue price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus supplement, and to certain securities dealers at such price less a concession not in excess of 1.75% of the face amount. In addition to the concession, any such securities dealer will receive from GS&Co. a structuring fee of up to 0.5% of the face amount of each such note.
In the future, GS&Co. or other affiliates of GS Finance Corp. may repurchase and resell the offered notes in market-making transactions, with resales being made at prices related to prevailing market prices at the time of resale or at negotiated prices. GS Finance Corp. estimates that its share of the total offering expenses, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ . For more information about the plan of distribution and possible market-making activities, see “Plan of Distribution” in the accompanying prospectus.
 We have been advised that GS&Co. will also pay a fee to iCapital Markets LLC, a broker-dealer in which an affiliate of GS Finance Corp. holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.
 We expect to deliver the notes against payment therefor in New York, New York on August 8, 2024. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.
 We have been advised by GS&Co. that it intends to make a market in the notes. However, neither GS&Co. nor any of our other affiliates that makes a market is obligated to do so and any of them may stop doing so at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity or trading market for the notes.
 The notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. For the purposes of this provision:
 (a)the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

 (i)a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or

 (ii)a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

 (iii)not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129; and

 (b)the expression an “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the notes.
 The notes may not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the "UK PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. For the purposes of this provision:
 (a)the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

 (i)a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); or

 S-38


(ii)a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; 
 (iii)or not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; and
 (b)the expression an “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the notes.
 Any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of the notes may only be communicated or caused to be communicated in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to GS Finance Corp. or The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
 All applicable provisions of the FSMA must be complied with in respect to anything done by any person in relation to the notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.
 The notes may not be offered or sold in Hong Kong by means of any document other than (i) to “professional investors” as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571 of the Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder, or (ii) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” as defined in the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32 of the Laws of Hong Kong) or which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of that Ordinance; and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere) which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the securities laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to the notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors” as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance and any rules made thereunder.

 Where the notes are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 of the SFA by a relevant person which is a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor (as defined in Section 4A of the SFA)) whose sole purpose is to hold investments and each beneficiary of the trust is an accredited investor, the beneficiaries’
S-39


rights and interest (howsoever described) in that trust shall not be transferable for six months after that trust has acquired the notes under Section 275 of the SFA except: (1) to an institutional investor under Section 274 of the SFA or to a relevant person (as defined in Section 275(2) of the SFA), (2) where such transfer arises from an offer that is made on terms that such rights or interest are acquired at a consideration of not less than S$200,000 (or its equivalent in a foreign currency) for each transaction (whether such amount is to be paid for in cash or by exchange of securities or other assets), (3) where no consideration is or will be given for the transfer, (4) where the transfer is by operation of law, (5) as specified in Section 276(7) of the SFA, or (6) as specified in Regulation 32.

The notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to or for the benefit of any resident of Japan (including any person resident in Japan or any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan) or to others for reoffering or resale, directly or indirectly, in Japan or to or for the benefit of any resident of Japan, except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the FIEA and otherwise in compliance with any relevant laws and regulations of Japan.
 The notes are not offered, sold or advertised, directly or indirectly, in, into or from Switzerland on the basis of a public offering and will not be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange or any other offering or regulated trading facility in Switzerland. Accordingly, neither this prospectus supplement nor any accompanying prospectus supplement, prospectus or other marketing material constitute a prospectus as defined in article 652a or article 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations or a listing prospectus as defined in article 32 of the Listing Rules of the SIX Swiss Exchange or any other regulated trading facility in Switzerland.

Conflicts of Interest
