 All Payments on the Securities Based on the Worst Performing of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index

 
Fully and Unconditionally Guaranteed by Morgan Stanley

 
Principal at Risk Securities

 The securities offered are unsecured obligations of Morgan Stanley Finance LLC (“MSFL”), fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Morgan Stanley, and have the terms described in the accompanying product supplement, index supplement and prospectus, as supplemented or modified by this document. The securities do not guarantee the repayment of principal and do not provide for the regular payment of interest. The securities will be automatically redeemed if the index closing value of each of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index, which we refer to as the underlying indices, on any of the semi-annual determination dates (beginning one year after the original issue date) is greater than or equal to its respective initial index value, for an early redemption payment that will increase over the term of the securities, as described below. No further payments will be made on the securities once they have been redeemed. At maturity, if the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to its respective initial index value, investors will receive a payment at maturity of at least $1,677.50 per $1,000 security (to be determined on the pricing date). If the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final index value of either underlying index is less than its respective initial index value but the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to 60% of its respective initial index value, which we refer to as the respective downside threshold level, investors will receive the stated principal amount of their investment. However, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final index value of either underlying index is less than its respective downside threshold level, investors will be exposed to the decline in the worst performing underlying index on a 1-to-1 basis, and will receive a payment at maturity that is less than 60% of the stated principal amount of the securities and could be zero. Accordingly, investors in the securities must be willing to accept the risk of losing their entire initial investment. These long-dated securities are for investors who are willing to forego current income and participation in the appreciation of either underlying index in exchange for the possibility of receiving an early redemption payment or payment at maturity greater than the stated principal amount if each underlying index closes at or above the initial index value on a semi-annual determination date. Because all payments on the securities are based on the worst performing of the underlying indices, a decline beyond the respective downside threshold level of either underlying index will result in a significant loss of your investment, even if the other underlying index has appreciated or has not declined as much. Investors will not participate in any appreciation of either underlying index. The securities are notes issued as part of MSFL’s Series A Global Medium-Term Notes program.
 All payments are subject to our credit risk. If we default on our obligations, you could lose some or all of your investment. These securities are not secured obligations and you will not have any security interest in, or otherwise have any access to, any underlying reference asset or assets.

Principal at Risk Securities

 The Jump Securities with Auto-Callable Feature due August 9, 2029, With 1-Year Initial Non-Call Period All Payments on the Securities Based on the Worst Performing of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index (the “securities”) do not provide for the regular payment of interest. Instead, the securities will be automatically redeemed if the index closing value of each of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index on any semi-annual determination date (beginning after one year) is greater than or equal to its respective initial index value, for an early redemption payment that will increase over the term of the securities, as described below. No further payments will be made on the securities once they have been redeemed. At maturity, if the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to its respective initial index value, investors will receive a payment at maturity of at least $1,677.50 per $1,000 security (to be determined on the pricing date). If the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final index value of either underlying index is less than its respective initial index value but the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to its respective downside threshold level, investors will receive the stated principal amount of their investment. However, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final index value of either underlying index is less than its respective downside threshold level, investors will be exposed to the decline in the worst performing underlying index on a 1-to-1 basis, and will receive a payment at maturity that is less than 60% of the stated principal amount of the securities and could be zero. Accordingly, investors in the securities must be willing to accept the risk of losing their entire initial investment. Investors will not participate in any appreciation in either underlying index.

|  1 | Payment at maturity: | If the securities have not previously been redeemed, you will receive at maturity a cash payment per security as follows: ●If the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to its respective initial index value: At least $1,677.50 (to be determined on the pricing date) ●If the final index value of either underlying index is less than its respective initial index value but the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to its respective downside threshold level: $1,000 ●If the final index value of either underlying index is less than its respective downside threshold level: $1,000 × index performance factor of the worst performing underlying index Under these circumstances, investors will lose a significant portion or all of their investment. Accordingly, investors in the securities must be willing to accept the risk of losing their entire initial investment. |
 The original issue price of each security is $1,000. This price includes costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the securities, which are borne by you, and, consequently, the estimated value of the securities on the pricing date will be less than $1,000. We estimate that the value of each security on the pricing date will be approximately $974.70, or within $40.00 of that estimate. Our estimate of the value of the securities as determined on the pricing date will be set forth in the final pricing supplement. 
 What goes into the estimated value on the pricing date?
 In valuing the securities on the pricing date, we take into account that the securities comprise both a debt component and a performance-based component linked to the underlying indices. The estimated value of the securities is determined using our own pricing and valuation models, market inputs and assumptions relating to the underlying indices, instruments based on the underlying indices, volatility and other factors including current and expected interest rates, as well as an interest rate related to our secondary market credit spread, which is the implied interest rate at which our conventional fixed rate debt trades in the secondary market.
 What determines the economic terms of the securities?
 In determining the economic terms of the securities, including the early redemption payment amounts and the downside threshold levels, we use an internal funding rate, which is likely to be lower than our secondary market credit spreads and therefore advantageous to us. If the issuing, selling, structuring and hedging costs borne by you were lower or if the internal funding rate were higher, one or more of the economic terms of the securities would be more favorable to you.
 What is the relationship between the estimated value on the pricing date and the secondary market price of the securities?
 The price at which MS & Co. purchases the securities in the secondary market, absent changes in market conditions, including those related to the underlying indices, may vary from, and be lower than, the estimated value on the pricing date, because the secondary market price takes into account our secondary market credit spread as well as the bid-offer spread that MS & Co. would charge in a secondary market transaction of this type and other factors. However, because the costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the securities are not fully deducted upon issuance, for a period of up to 6 months following the issue date, to the extent that MS & Co. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, absent changes in market conditions, including those related to the underlying indices, and to our secondary market credit spreads, it would do so based on values higher than the estimated value. We expect that those higher values will also be reflected in your brokerage account statements.
 MS & Co. may, but is not obligated to, make a market in the securities, and, if it once chooses to make a market, may cease doing so at any time.

Key Investment Rationale

 The securities do not provide for the regular payment of interest. Instead, the securities will be automatically redeemed if the index closing value of each of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index on any semi-annual determination date is greater than or equal to its respective initial index value.
 The following scenarios are for illustrative purposes only to demonstrate how an automatic early redemption payment or the payment at maturity (if the securities have not previously been redeemed) are calculated, and do not attempt to demonstrate every situation that may occur. Accordingly, the securities may or may not be redeemed prior to maturity and the payment at maturity may be less than 60% of the stated principal amount of the securities and may be zero.

|  1 | Scenario 1: The securities are redeemed prior to maturity                                                                       | When each underlying index closes at or above its respective initial index value on any semi-annual determination date (beginning one year after the original issue date), the securities will be automatically redeemed for the applicable early redemption payment on the related early redemption date. Investors do not participate in any appreciation in either underlying index.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  2 | Scenario 2: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, and investors receive a fixed positive return at maturity        | This scenario assumes that at least one underlying index closes below its respective initial index value on each of the semi-annual determination dates. Consequently, the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity. On the final determination date, each underlying index closes at or above its respective initial index value. At maturity, investors will receive a cash payment equal to at least $1,677.50 per stated principal amount (to be determined on the pricing date). Investors do not participate in any appreciation in either underlying index.                                                                                  |
|  3 | Scenario 3: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, and investors receive the stated principal amount at maturity    | This scenario assumes that at least one underlying index closes below its respective initial index value on each of the semi-annual determination dates. Consequently, the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity. On the final determination date, at least one underlying index closes below its respective initial index value, but the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to its respective downside threshold level. At maturity, investors will receive a cash payment equal to the stated principal amount of $1,000 per security.                                                                        |
|  4 | Scenario 4: The securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, and investors suffer a substantial loss of principal at maturity | This scenario assumes that at least one underlying index closes below its respective initial index value on each of the semi-annual determination dates. Consequently, the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity. On the final determination date, at least one underlying index closes below its respective downside threshold level. At maturity, investors will receive an amount equal to the stated principal amount multiplied by the index performance factor of the worst performing underlying index. Under these circumstances, the payment at maturity will be significantly less than the stated principal amount and could be zero. |

Hypothetical Examples

 The following hypothetical examples are for illustrative purposes only. Whether the securities are redeemed prior to maturity will be determined by reference to the index closing value of each underlying index on each of the semi-annual determination dates, and the payment at maturity, if any, will be determined by reference to the index closing value of each underlying index on the final determination date. The actual early redemption payment with respect to each applicable determination date, initial index values and downside threshold levels will be determined on the pricing date. Some numbers appearing in the examples below have been rounded for ease of analysis. All payments on the securities are subject to our credit risk. The below examples are based on the following terms:

|  1 | Hypothetical Early Redemption Payment: | The hypothetical early redemption payment will be an amount in cash per stated principal amount (corresponding to a return of approximately 13.55% per annum) for each semi-annual determination date (beginning after one year), as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |           |

 Example 1 — The securities are redeemed following the second determination date.

|  1 | Date                   | RTY Index Closing Value                     | SX5E Index Closing Value                    | Payment (per Security) |
|  2 | 1st Determination Date | 2,000 (at or above the initial index value) | 3,000 (below the initial index value)       | --                     |
|  3 | 2nd Determination Date | 2,100 (at or above the initial index value) | 4,000 (at or above the initial index value) | $1,203.25              |

 In this example, on the first determination date, the index closing value of one of the underlying indices is at or above its respective initial index value, but the index closing value of the other underlying index is below its respective initial index value. Therefore, the securities are not redeemed. On the second determination date, the index closing value of each underlying index is at or above the respective initial index value. Therefore, the securities are automatically redeemed on the second early redemption date. Investors will receive a payment of $1,203.25 per security on the related early redemption date. No further payments will be made on the securities once they have been redeemed, and investors do not participate in the appreciation in either underlying index.
 
How to calculate the payment at maturity:

 In the following examples, one or both of the underlying indices close below the respective initial index value(s) on each of the semi-annual determination dates (beginning after one year), and, consequently, the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to, and remain outstanding until, maturity.

|  4 | Example 3: | 2,250 (at or above its initial index value and downside threshold level)           | 1,950 (below its downside threshold level)                                         | $1,000 × (1,950 / 3,900) = $500    |
|  5 | Example 4: | 360 (below its downside threshold level)                                           | 3,120 (below its initial index value but at or above its downside threshold level) | $1,000 × (360 / 1,800) = $200      |

 In example 1, the final index value of each underlying index is at or above its respective initial index value. Therefore, investors receive $1,677.50 per security at maturity. Investors do not participate in any appreciation in either underlying index.
 In example 2, the final index value of one of the underlying indices is at or above its initial index value and downside threshold level, but the final index value of the other underlying index is below its initial index value and at or above its downside threshold level. The SX5E Index has increased 20% from its initial index value to its final index value and the RTY Index has declined 20% from its initial index value to its final index value. Therefore, investors receive a payment at maturity equal to the stated principal amount of $1,000 per security. Investors do not participate in any appreciation in either underlying index.
 In example 3, the final index value of one of the underlying indices is at or above its initial index value and downside threshold level, but the final index value of the other underlying index is below its respective downside threshold level. Therefore, investors are exposed to the downside performance of the worst performing underlying index at maturity. The RTY Index has increased 25% from its initial index value to its final index value and the SX5E Index has declined 50% from its initial index value to its final index value. Therefore, investors receive at maturity an amount equal to the stated principal amount multiplied by the index performance factor of the SX5E Index, which is the worst performing underlying index in this example.
 In example 4, the final index value of one of the underlying indices is below its initial index value but at or above its downside threshold level, while the final index value of the other underlying index is below its respective downside threshold level. Therefore, investors are exposed to the downside performance of the worst performing underlying index at maturity. The SX5E Index has declined 20% from its initial index value to its final index value and the RTY Index has declined 80% from its initial index value to its final index value. Therefore, investors receive at maturity an amount equal to the stated principal amount multiplied by the index performance factor of the RTY Index, which is the worst performing underlying index in this example.

 In example 5, the final index value of each underlying index is below its respective downside threshold level, and investors receive at maturity an amount equal to the stated principal amount multiplied by the index performance factor of the worst performing underlying index. The RTY Index has declined 80% from its initial index value to its final index value and the SX5E Index has declined 60% from its initial index value to its final index value. Therefore, the payment at maturity equals the stated principal amount multiplied by the index performance factor of the RTY Index, which is the worst performing underlying index in this example. 
 If the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final index value of either underlying index is below its respective downside threshold level, you will be exposed to the downside performance of the worst performing underlying index at maturity, and your payment at maturity will be less than 60% of the stated principal amount per security and could be zero.

Risk Factors

 This section describes the material risks relating to the securities. For further discussion of these and other risks, you should read the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the accompanying product supplement, index supplement and prospectus. We also urge you to consult with your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers in connection with your investment in the securities.
 
Risks Relating to an Investment in the Securities

 ￭The securities do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any principal. The terms of the securities differ from those of ordinary debt securities in that they do not pay interest or guarantee the return of any of the principal amount at maturity. If the securities have not been automatically redeemed prior to maturity and the final index value of either underlying index is less than its respective downside threshold level of 60% of its initial index value, you will be exposed to the decline in the value of the worst performing underlying index, as compared to its initial index value, on a 1-to-1 basis, and you will receive for each security that you hold at maturity an amount equal to the stated principal amount multiplied by the index performance factor of the worst performing underlying index. In this case, the payment at maturity will be less than 60% of the stated principal amount and could be zero.
 ￭The appreciation potential of the securities is limited by the fixed early redemption payment or payment at maturity specified for each determination date. The appreciation potential of the securities is limited to the fixed early redemption payment specified for each determination date if each underlying index closes at or above its respective initial index value on any semi-annual determination date, or to the fixed upside payment at maturity if the securities have not been redeemed and the final index value of each underlying index is at or above its initial index value. In all cases, you will not participate in any appreciation of either underlying index, which could be significant.
 ￭The market price will be influenced by many unpredictable factors. Several factors, many of which are beyond our control, will influence the value of the securities in the secondary market and the price at which MS & Co. may be willing to purchase or sell the securities in the secondary market. We expect that generally the level of interest rates available in the market and the value of each underlying index on any day, including in relation to its respective initial index value and downside threshold level, will affect the value of the securities more than any other factors. Other factors that may influence the value of the securities include:
 othe volatility (frequency and magnitude of changes in value) of the underlying indices,
 ogeopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events that affect the component stocks of the underlying indices or securities markets generally and which may affect the value of each underlying index,
 odividend rates on the securities underlying the underlying indices,
 othe time remaining until the securities mature,
 ointerest and yield rates in the market,
 othe availability of comparable instruments,
 othe composition of the underlying indices and changes in the constituent stocks of such indices, and
 oany actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads.
 Some or all of these factors will influence the price that you will receive if you sell your securities prior to maturity. Generally, the longer the time remaining to maturity, the more the market price of the securities will be affected by the other factors described above. For example, you may have to sell your securities at a substantial discount from the stated principal amount of $1,000 per security if the price of either underlying index at the time of sale is near or below its downside threshold level or if market interest rates rise.
 You cannot predict the future performance of either underlying index based on its historical performance. The value(s) of one or both of the underlying indices may decrease so that you will receive no return on your investment and receive a payment at maturity that is less than 60% of the stated principal amount. See “Russell 2000® Index Overview” and “EURO STOXX 50® Index Overview” below.
 ￭The securities are subject to our credit risk, and any actual or anticipated changes to our credit ratings or credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the securities. You are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the securities upon an early redemption or at maturity and therefore you are subject to our credit risk. If we default on our obligations under the securities, your investment would be at risk and you could lose some or all of your investment. As a result, the market value of the securities prior to maturity will be affected by changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any actual or anticipated decline in our credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking our credit risk is likely to adversely affect the market value of the securities.
 ￭As a finance subsidiary, MSFL has no independent operations and will have no independent assets. As a finance subsidiary, MSFL has no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of its securities and will have no independent assets available for distributions to holders of MSFL securities if they make claims in respect of such securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or similar proceeding. Accordingly, any recoveries by such holders will be limited to those available under

 the related guarantee by Morgan Stanley and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Morgan Stanley. Holders will have recourse only to a single claim against Morgan Stanley and its assets under the guarantee. Holders of securities issued by MSFL should accordingly assume that in any such proceedings they would not have any priority over and should be treated pari passu with the claims of other unsecured, unsubordinated creditors of Morgan Stanley, including holders of Morgan Stanley-issued securities.
 ￭Not equivalent to investing in the underlying indices. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing in either underlying index or the component stocks of either underlying index. Investors in the securities will not participate in any positive performance of either underlying index, and will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to stocks that constitute either underlying index.
 ￭Reinvestment risk. The term of your investment in the securities may be shortened due to the automatic early redemption feature of the securities. If the securities are redeemed prior to maturity, you will receive no further payments on the securities and may be forced to invest in a lower interest rate environment and may not be able to reinvest at comparable terms or returns. However, under no circumstances will the securities be redeemed in the first year of the term of the securities.
 ￭The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange and secondary trading may be limited, and accordingly, you should be willing to hold your securities for the entire 5-year term of the securities. The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore, there may be little or no secondary market for the securities. MS & Co. may, but is not obligated to, make a market in the securities and, if it once chooses to make a market, may cease doing so at any time. When it does make a market, it will generally do so for transactions of routine secondary market size at prices based on its estimate of the current value of the securities, taking into account its bid/offer spread, our credit spreads, market volatility, the notional size of the proposed sale, the cost of unwinding any related hedging positions, the time remaining to maturity and the likelihood that it will be able to resell the securities. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily. Since other broker-dealers may not participate significantly in the secondary market for the securities, the price at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which MS & Co. is willing to transact. If, at any time, MS & Co. were to cease making a market in the securities, it is likely that there would be no secondary market for the securities. Accordingly, you should be willing to hold your securities to maturity.
 ￭The rate we are willing to pay for securities of this type, maturity and issuance size is likely to be lower than the rate implied by our secondary market credit spreads and advantageous to us. Both the lower rate and the inclusion of costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the securities in the original issue price reduce the economic terms of the securities, cause the estimated value of the securities to be less than the original issue price and will adversely affect secondary market prices. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors, the prices, if any, at which dealers, including MS & Co., may be willing to purchase the securities in secondary market transactions will likely be significantly lower than the original issue price, because secondary market prices will exclude the issuing, selling, structuring and hedging-related costs that are included in the original issue price and borne by you and because the secondary market prices will reflect our secondary market credit spreads and the bid-offer spread that any dealer would charge in a secondary market transaction of this type as well as other factors.
 The inclusion of the costs of issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the securities in the original issue price and the lower rate we are willing to pay as issuer make the economic terms of the securities less favorable to you than they otherwise would be.
 However, because the costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the securities are not fully deducted upon issuance, for a period of up to 6 months following the issue date, to the extent that MS & Co. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, absent changes in market conditions, including those related to the underlying indices, and to our secondary market credit spreads, it would do so based on values higher than the estimated value, and we expect that those higher values will also be reflected in your brokerage account statements.
 ￭The estimated value of the securities is determined by reference to our pricing and valuation models, which may differ from those of other dealers, and is not a maximum or minimum secondary market price.  These pricing and valuation models are proprietary and rely in part on subjective views of certain market inputs and certain assumptions about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, because there is no market-standard way to value these types of securities, our models may yield a higher estimated value of the securities than those generated by others, including other dealers in the market, if they attempted to value the securities. In addition, the estimated value on the pricing date does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which dealers, including MS & Co., would be willing to purchase your securities in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The value of your securities at any time after the date of this document will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including our creditworthiness and changes in market conditions. See also “The market price will be influenced by many unpredictable factors” above.
 ￭Hedging and trading activity by our affiliates could potentially affect the value of the securities. One or more of our affiliates and/or third-party dealers expect to carry out hedging activities related to the securities (and to other instruments linked to the underlying indices or their component stocks), including trading in the stocks that constitute the underlying indices as well as in

 other instruments related to the underlying indices. As a result, these entities may be unwinding or adjusting hedge positions during the term of the securities, and the hedging strategy may involve greater and more frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as the final determination date approaches. Some of our affiliates also trade the stocks that constitute the underlying indices and other financial instruments related to the underlying indices on a regular basis as part of their general broker-dealer and other businesses. Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could potentially increase the initial index value of an underlying index, and, therefore, could increase (i) the value at or above which such underlying index must close on the determination dates so that the securities are redeemed prior to maturity for the early redemption payment (depending also on the performance of the other underlying index) and (ii) the downside threshold level for such underlying index, which is the value at or above which such underlying index must close on the final determination date so that you are not exposed to the negative performance of the worst performing underlying index at maturity (depending also on the performance of the other underlying index). Additionally, such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities could potentially affect the value of either underlying index on the determination dates, and, accordingly, whether we redeem the securities prior to maturity and the amount of cash you will receive at maturity, if any.
 ￭The calculation agent, which is a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley and an affiliate of MSFL, will make determinations with respect to the securities. As calculation agent, MS & Co. will determine the initial index values, the downside threshold levels, the final index values, whether the securities will be redeemed on any early redemption date and the payment at maturity, if any. Moreover, certain determinations made by MS & Co., in its capacity as calculation agent, may require it to exercise discretion and make subjective judgments, such as with respect to the occurrence or non-occurrence of market disruption events and the selection of a successor index or calculation of an index closing value in the event of a market disruption event or discontinuance of an underlying index. These potentially subjective determinations may affect the payout to you upon an early redemption or at maturity, if any. For further information regarding these types of determinations, see “Description of Auto-Callable Securities—Postponement of Determination Dates,” “—Alternate Exchange Calculation in Case of an Event of Default,” “—Discontinuance of Any Underlying Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation” and “—Calculation Agent and Calculations” in the accompanying product supplement. In addition, MS & Co. has determined the estimated value of the securities on the pricing date.
 ￭The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities are uncertain. Please read the discussion under “Additional Information – Tax considerations” in this document and the discussion under “United States Federal Taxation” in the accompanying product supplement for auto-callable securities (together, the “Tax Disclosure Sections”) concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities. There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal tax treatment of the securities, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the tax treatment of a security as a single financial contract that is an “open transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment of the securities, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the securities, including the timing and character of income recognized by U.S. Holders and the withholding tax consequences to Non-U.S. Holders, might be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, future legislation, Treasury regulations or IRS guidance could adversely affect the U.S. federal tax treatment of the securities, possibly retroactively. 
 Both U.S. and Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities, including possible alternative treatments, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

 Risks Relating to the Underlying Indices

 ￭You are exposed to the price risk of each underlying index. Your return on the securities is not linked to a basket consisting of each underlying index. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each underlying index. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets, in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each underlying index. Poor performance by either underlying index over the term of the securities may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any positive performance by the other underlying index. To receive an early redemption payment, each underlying index must close at or above its respective initial index value on the applicable determination date. In addition, if the securities have not been redeemed and at least one underlying index has declined to below its respective downside threshold level as of the final determination date, you will be fully exposed to the decline in the worst performing underlying index over the term of the securities on a 1-to-1 basis, even if the other underlying index has appreciated or has not declined as much. Under this scenario, the value of any such payment at maturity will be less than 60% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the price risk of each underlying index.
 ￭The securities are linked to the Russell 2000® Index and are subject to risks associated with small-capitalization companies.  As the Russell 2000® Index is one of the underlying indices, and the Russell 2000® Index consists of stocks issued by companies with relatively small market capitalization, the securities are linked to the value of small-capitalization companies.  These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-

 capitalization companies and therefore the Russell 2000® Index may be more volatile than indices that consist of stocks issued by large-capitalization companies.  Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments, and the stocks of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded.  In addition, small capitalization companies are typically less well-established and less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel.  Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.
 ￭There are risks associated with investments in securities linked to the value of foreign equity securities. As the EURO STOXX 50® Index is one of the underlying indices, the securities are linked to the value of foreign equity securities. Investments in securities linked to the value of foreign equity securities involve risks associated with the securities markets in those countries, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross-shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies than about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and foreign companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities issued in foreign markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws. Local securities markets may trade a small number of securities and may be unable to respond effectively to increases in trading volume, potentially making prompt liquidation of holdings difficult or impossible at times. Moreover, the economies in such countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from the economy in the United States in such respects as growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources, self-sufficiency and balance of payment positions.
 ￭Adjustments to the underlying indices could adversely affect the value of the securities. The publisher of each underlying index may add, delete or substitute the component stocks of such underlying index or make other methodological changes that could change the value of the underlying index. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the securities. The publisher of each underlying index may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of such underlying index at any time. In these circumstances, MS & Co., as the calculation agent, will have the sole discretion to substitute a successor index that is comparable to the discontinued index. MS & Co. could have an economic interest that is different than that of investors in the securities insofar as, for example, MS & Co. is permitted to consider indices that are calculated and published by MS & Co. or any of its affiliates. If MS & Co. determines that there is no appropriate successor index, the determination of whether the securities will be redeemed on any subsequent early redemption date or the payment at maturity, as applicable, will be based on whether the value of such underlying index based on the closing prices of the securities constituting such underlying index at the time of such discontinuance, without rebalancing or substitution, computed by MS & Co. as calculation agent in accordance with the formula for calculating such underlying index last in effect prior to such discontinuance is greater than or equal to the initial index value or downside threshold level, as applicable (depending also on the performance of the other underlying index).

 Russell 2000® Index Overview

 The Russell 2000® Index is an index calculated, published and disseminated by FTSE International Limited (“FTSE Russell”), and measures the capitalization-weighted price performance of 2,000 U.S. small-capitalization stocks listed on eligible U.S. exchanges. The Russell 2000® Index is designed to track the performance of the small-capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. The companies included in the Russell 2000® Index are the middle 2,000 (i.e., those ranked 1,001 through 3,000) of the companies that form the Russell 3000E™ Index. The Russell 2000® Index represents approximately 7% of the U.S. equity market. For additional information about the Russell 2000® Index, see the information set forth under “Russell Indices—Russell 2000® Index” in the accompanying index supplement.

|  3 | Tax considerations:     | Although there is uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities due to the lack of governing authority, in the opinion of our counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, under current law, and based on current market conditions, it is reasonable to treat a security as a single financial contract that is an “open transaction” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, because our counsel’s opinion is based in part on market conditions as of the date of this document, it is subject to confirmation on the pricing date. Assuming this treatment of the securities is respected and subject to the discussion in “United States Federal Taxation” in the accompanying product supplement for auto-callable securities, the following U.S. federal income tax consequences should result based on current law: ￭A U.S. Holder should not be required to recognize taxable income over the term of the securities prior to settlement, other than pursuant to a sale or exchange. ￭Upon sale, exchange or settlement of the securities, a U.S. Holder should recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the securities. Such gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if the investor has held the securities for more than one year, and short-term capital gain or loss otherwise. We do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the treatment of the securities. An alternative characterization of the securities could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of ownership and disposition of the securities, including the timing and character of income recognized. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have requested comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar financial instruments and have indicated that such transactions may be the subject of future regulations or other guidance. Furthermore, members of Congress have proposed legislative changes to the tax treatment of derivative contracts. Any legislation, Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the securities, possibly with retroactive effect. As discussed in the accompanying product supplement for auto-callable securities, Section 871(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 871(m)”) generally impose a 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) withholding tax on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities or indices that include U.S. equities (each, an “Underlying Security”). Subject to certain exceptions, Section 871(m) generally applies to securities that substantially replicate the economic performance of one or more Underlying Securities, as determined based on tests set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations (a “Specified Security”). However, pursuant to an IRS notice, Section 871(m) will not apply to securities issued before January 1, 2027 that do not have a delta of one with respect to any Underlying Security. Based on the terms of the securities and current market conditions, we expect that the securities will not have a delta of one with respect to any Underlying Security on the pricing date. However, we will provide an updated determination in the pricing supplement. Assuming that the securities do not have a delta of one with respect to any Underlying Security, our counsel is of the opinion that the securities should not be Specified Securities and, therefore, should not be subject to Section 871(m). Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to the amounts so withheld. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the securities. Both U.S. and non-U.S. investors considering an investment in the securities should read the discussion under “Risk Factors” in this document and the discussion under “United States Federal Taxation” in the accompanying product supplement for auto-callable securities and consult their tax advisers regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the securities, including possible alternative treatments, and any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non- |

The discussion in the preceding paragraphs under “Tax considerations” and the discussion contained in the section entitled “United States Federal Taxation” in the accompanying product supplement for auto-callable securities, insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto, constitute the full opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP regarding the material U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the securities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  2 | Use of proceeds and hedging:                                                    | The proceeds from the sale of the securities will be used by us for general corporate purposes. We will receive, in aggregate, $1,000 per security issued, because, when we enter into hedging transactions in order to meet our obligations under the securities, our hedging counterparty will reimburse the cost of the agent’s commissions. The costs of the securities borne by you and described beginning on page 4 above comprise the agent’s commissions and the cost of issuing, structuring and hedging the securities. On or prior to the pricing date, we will hedge our anticipated exposure in connection with the securities by entering into hedging transactions with our affiliates and/or third-party dealers. We expect our hedging counterparties to take positions in the stocks constituting the underlying indices, in futures and/or options contracts on the underlying indices or the component stocks of the underlying indices listed on major securities markets, or positions in any other available securities or instruments that they may wish to use in connection with such hedging. Such purchase activity could potentially increase the initial index value of an underlying index, and, as a result, increase (i) the level at or above which such underlying index must close on the determination dates so that the securities are redeemed prior to maturity for the early redemption payment (depending also on the performance of the other underlying index) and (ii) the downside threshold level for such underlying index, which is the level at or above which such underlying index must close on the final determination date so that you are not exposed to the negative performance of the worst performing underlying index at maturity (depending also on the performance of the other underlying index). These entities may be unwinding or adjusting hedge positions during the term of the securities, and the hedging strategy may involve greater and more frequent dynamic adjustments to the hedge as the final determination date approaches. Additionally, our hedging activities, as well as our other trading activities, during the term of the securities could potentially affect the value of either underlying index on the determination dates, and, accordingly, whether we redeem the securities prior to maturity and the amount of cash you will receive at maturity, if any.
