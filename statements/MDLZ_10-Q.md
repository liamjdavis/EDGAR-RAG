Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

Note 1. Basis of Presentation 

Our interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) have been omitted. It is management’s opinion that these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results. For a complete set of consolidated financial statements and related notes, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Principles of Consolidation

The condensed consolidated financial statements include Mondelēz International, Inc. as well as our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries, except our Venezuelan subsidiaries that were deconsolidated in 2015. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. The noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling investors' interests in the results of subsidiaries that we control and consolidate. We account for investments over which we exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. Investments with readily determinable fair values for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are measured at fair value.

War in Ukraine

In February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we closed our operations and facilities in Ukraine. In March 2022, our two Ukrainian manufacturing facilities in Trostyanets and Vyshhorod were significantly damaged. In the second quarter of 2024, we fully resumed production at both facilities after completing targeted repairs. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries and continue to evaluate our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis. We continue to evaluate the uncertainty of the ongoing effects of the war in Ukraine and its impact on the global economic environment, and we cannot predict if it will have a significant impact in the future.

Highly Inflationary Accounting

Within our consolidated entities, Argentina and Türkiye (Turkey) are accounted for as highly inflationary economies. Argentina and Türkiye represent 1.6% and 0.5% of our consolidated net revenues with remeasurement losses of $8 million and $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, and 1.5% and 0.7% of our consolidated net revenues with remeasurement losses of $10 million and $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Given the continued volatility of these currencies, impacts to our financial statements in future periods could be significantly different from historical levels.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash primarily includes cash held on behalf of financial institutions in accordance with accounts receivable factoring arrangements and letters of credit arrangements with legally restricted cash collateral provisions. Restricted cash is recorded within other current assets and was $72 million as of June 30, 2024 and $74 million as of December 31, 2023. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $1,471 million as of June 30, 2024 and $1,884 million as of December 31, 2023.

Transfers of Financial Assets

The outstanding principal amount of receivables under our uncommitted revolving non-recourse accounts receivable factoring arrangements amounted to $739 million as of June 30, 2024 and $262 million as of December 31, 2023. The incremental cost of factoring receivables under this arrangement was not material for all periods presented. The proceeds from the sales of receivables are included in cash from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

Non-Cash Lease Transactions

We recorded $53 million in operating lease and $68 million in finance lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $62 million in operating lease and $73 million in finance lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations during the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Supply Chain Financing

As part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. We also facilitate voluntary supply chain financing (“SCF”) programs through several participating financial institutions. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that our outstanding accounts payable related to suppliers that participate in the SCF programs was $2.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2022, the FASB issued an ASU which enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring additional disclosure about the key terms of these programs and a roll-forward of the related obligations to understand the effects of these programs on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the roll-forward requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted, with the exception of the roll-forward requirement, this standard in the first quarter of 2023 and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In November 2023, the FASB issued an ASU which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related segment disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued an ASU which enhances the transparency of income tax disclosures, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and early adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.


Note 2. Divestitures 


Developed Market Gum

On October 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our developed market gum business in the United States, Canada and Europe to Perfetti Van Melle Group, excluding the Portugal business which we sold on October 23, 2023 after obtaining regulatory approval.
We recorded divestiture-related costs of zero in the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $22 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023 and recorded divestiture-related costs of $4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $52 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023. 
This disposition was not considered a strategic shift that would have a major effect on our operations or financial results; therefore, the results of the disposed business were not classified as discontinued operations.

(1)In 2023, we recorded $26 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to a chocolate brand in the North America segment for $20 million and a biscuit brand in the Europe segment for $6 million in the third quarter.
Indefinite-life intangible assets consist principally of brand names purchased through our acquisitions of Nabisco Holdings Corp., the global LU biscuit business of Groupe Danone S.A., Cadbury Limited and Clif Bar. Definite-life intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, customer-related intangibles, process technology, licenses and non-compete agreements. 
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $37 million for the three months and $75 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $37 million for the three months and $76 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. For the next five years, we currently estimate annual amortization expense of approximately $125 million in 2024-2026 and approximately $90 million in 2027 and 2028 (reflecting June 30, 2024 exchange rates).

Impairment Assessment:

We test our reporting units and brands for impairment annually as of July 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or brand is less than its carrying amount. During the second quarter of 2024, we evaluated our goodwill impairment and intangible asset impairment risk through an assessment of potential triggering events. We considered qualitative and quantitative information in our assessment. We concluded there were no impairment indicators.
During our 2023 annual indefinite-life intangible asset testing, we identified thirteen brands that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less. The aggregate book value of the thirteen brands was $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2024, of which $1.8 billion is related to five recently acquired brands. We believe our current plans for each of these brands will support the current carrying values, but if plans to grow brand earnings and expand margin are not met or specific valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future.


Note 6. Investments 


Marketable Securities

During the first quarter of 2023, our ownership in Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ: "KDP") fell below 5% of the outstanding shares, resulting in a change of accounting for our KDP investment, from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values ("marketable securities") as we no longer had significant influence over KDP. Marketable securities are measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1). 
On June 8, 2023, we sold 23 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership by 1.6 percentage points, from 3.2% to 1.6% of the total outstanding shares. We received proceeds of approximately $708 million.
On March 2, 2023, we sold 30 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership by 2.1 percentage points, from 5.3% to 3.2% of the total outstanding shares. We received proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion and prior to the change of accounting for our KDP investment, recorded a pre-tax gain on equity method transactions of $493 million ($368 million after-tax) during the first quarter of 2023.
Subsequently in 2023, we sold the remainder of our shares of KDP and exited our investment in the company.
Pre-tax (losses)/gains for marketable securities are summarized below:

In the table above, (loss)/gain on marketable securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the marketable securities at the beginning of the period or the date of the change of accounting for our investment in KDP, if later. 
We reported no marketable securities as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and $705 million as of June 30, 2023 in Other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Equity Method Investments

Our equity method investments include, but are not limited to, our ownership interests in JDE Peet's (Euronext Amsterdam: "JDEP"), Dong Suh Foods Corporation and Dong Suh Oil & Fats Co. Ltd. Our ownership interests may change over time due to investee stock-based compensation arrangements, share issuances or other equity-related transactions. As of June 30, 2024, we owned 17.7%, 50.0% and 49.0%, respectively, of these companies' outstanding shares. We continue to have board representation with two directors on JDEP's Board of Directors and have retained certain additional governance rights. As we continue to have significant influence, we continue to account for our investment in JDEP under the equity method. 
Our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting totaled $2.5 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. We recorded equity earnings of $48 million and cash dividends of $2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024, and equity earnings of $71 million and cash dividends of zero in the three months ended June 30, 2023. We recorded equity earnings of $79 million and cash dividends of $82 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024 and equity earnings of $106 million and cash dividends of $102 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023.
Based on the quoted closing prices as of June 30, 2024, the fair value of our publicly-traded investment in JDEP was $1.7 billion, and there was no other than temporary impairment identified during the three months ended June 30, 2024.

During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment based on the period of time for which the quoted market price fair value had been less than the carrying value of the investment and the uncertainty surrounding JDEP's stock price recovering to the carrying value. As a result, the investment was written down to its estimated fair value based on the closing price of the underlying equity security of €19.46 per share on March 28, 2024, resulting in an impairment charge of €612 million ($665 million). This charge was included within (Loss)/gain on equity method investment transactions including impairments in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings. There was no other than temporary impairment identified in the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.
JDEP Transactions
On April 3, 2023, we sold approximately 7.7 million shares of JDEP, which reduced our ownership by 1.6 percentage points, from 19.7% to 18.1% of the total outstanding shares. We received cash proceeds of €198 million ($217 million) and recorded a loss of €18 million ($19 million) on this sale during the three months ended June 30, 2023.
On March 30, 2023, we issued options to sell shares of JDEP in tranches equivalent to approximately 7.7 million shares. These options were exercisable at their maturities which were between July 3, 2023 and September 29, 2023, with strike prices ranging from €26.10 to €28.71 per share. Subsequent to the three months ended June 30, 2023, we exercised options on 2.2 million of the 7.7 million shares.
In 2021, we issued €300 million exchangeable bonds, which are redeemable at maturity in September 2024 at their principal amount in cash or, at our option, through the delivery of an equivalent number of JDEP’s ordinary shares based on an initial exchange price of €35.40 and, as the case may be, an additional amount in cash. If all bonds were redeemed in exchange for JDEP's shares, this would represent approximately 8.5 million shares or approximately 10% of our equity interest in JDEP as of June 30, 2024.

Note 7. Restructuring Program 

On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion 2014-2018 restructuring program and up to $2.2 billion of capital expenditures. On August 31, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a $600 million reallocation between restructuring program cash costs and capital expenditures so the $5.7 billion program consisted of approximately $4.1 billion of restructuring program charges ($3.1 billion cash costs and $1.0 billion non-cash costs) and up to $1.6 billion of capital expenditures. On September 6, 2018, our Board of Directors approved an extension of the restructuring program through 2022, an increase of $1.3 billion in the program charges and an increase of $700 million in capital expenditures. On October 21, 2021, our Board of Directors approved an extension of the restructuring program through 2023, and on July 25, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a further extension of the restructuring program through December 31, 2024. The total $7.7 billion program now consists of $5.4 billion of program charges ($4.1 billion of cash costs and $1.3 billion of non-cash costs) and total capital expenditures of $2.3 billion to be incurred over the life of the program. The current restructuring program, as increased and extended by these actions, is now called the Simplify to Grow Program.
The primary objective of the Simplify to Grow Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. The program covers severance as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing and procurement-related one-time costs. Since inception, we have incurred total restructuring and implementation charges of $5.3 billion related to the Simplify to Grow Program. We expect to incur the remainder of the program charges by year-end 2024.

Implementation Costs

Implementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers of our financial statements with additional information on the total costs of our Simplify to Grow Program. Implementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing our operations and facilities in connection with our supply chain reinvention program and other identified productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and the simplification of our information systems. Within our continuing results of operations, we recorded implementation costs of $12 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023, and we recorded implementation costs of $23 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and general corporate expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.

(1)Prior year facility amount has been revised.
(2)We maintain senior unsecured revolving credit facilities for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, and to support our commercial paper program. The revolving credit agreements include a covenant that we maintain a minimum shareholders' equity of at least $25.0 billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses), the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting principles and earnings/(losses) recognized in connection with the ongoing application of any mark-to-market accounting for pensions and other retirement plans. At June 30, 2024, we complied with this covenant as our shareholders' equity, as defined by the covenant, was $39.2 billion. The revolving credit facility also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. There are no credit rating triggers, provisions or other financial covenants that could require us to post collateral as security.
(3)On April 18, 2023, and subsequently amended on October 3, 2023 and April 4, 2024, we entered into a credit facility secured by pledged deposits classified as long-term other assets. Draw downs on the facility bear a variable rate based on SOFR plus applicable margin. On April 5, 2024, we drew down $0.15 billion which is due on February 15, 2029.

(1)Net investment hedge derivative contracts consist of cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward contracts and options. We also designate some of our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt to hedge a portion of our net investments in our non-U.S. operations. This debt is not reflected in the table above, but is included in long-term debt discussed in Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements. Both net investment hedge derivative contracts and non-U.S. dollar denominated debt acting as net investment hedges are also disclosed in the Derivative Volume table and the Hedges of Net Investments in International Operations section appearing later in this footnote.
We recorded the fair value of our derivative instruments in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as follows:

Level 1 financial assets and liabilities consist of exchange-traded commodity futures and listed options. The fair value of these instruments is determined based on quoted market prices on commodity exchanges. 
Level 2 financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of over-the-counter (“OTC”) currency exchange forwards, options and swaps; commodity forwards and options; net investment hedge contracts; and interest rate swaps. Our currency exchange contracts are valued using an income approach based on observable market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the observable market commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount or based on pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as commodity prices. Our bifurcated exchange options are valued, as derivative instrument liabilities, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model requires assumptions related to the market price of the underlying note and associated credit spread combined with the share of price, expected dividend yield, and expected volatility of the JDE Peet’s shares over the life of the option. Our calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the observable market interest rate curve. Our calculation of the fair value of financial instruments takes into consideration the risk of nonperformance, including counterparty credit risk. Our OTC derivative transactions are governed by International Swap Dealers Association agreements and other standard industry contracts. Under these agreements, we do not post nor require collateral from our counterparties. The majority of our derivative contracts do not have a legal right of set-off. We manage the credit risk in connection with these and all our derivatives by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties.

Cash Flow Hedges

Cash flow hedge activity, net of taxes, is recorded within accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses). Refer to Note 13, Reclassifications from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for additional information on current period activity. Based on current market conditions, we would expect to transfer gains of $48 million (net of taxes) for interest rate cash flow hedges to earnings during the next 12 months.

Cash Flow Hedge Coverage

As of June 30, 2024, our longest dated cash flow hedges were interest rate swaps that hedge forecasted interest rate payments over the next 4 years, 6 months. 

Hedges of Net Investments in International Operations

Net investment hedge ("NIH") derivative contracts
We enter into cross-currency interest rate swaps, forwards and options to hedge certain investments in our non-U.S. operations against movements in exchange rates. The aggregate notional value as of June 30, 2024 was $8.0 billion.

(1)In connection with the Clif Bar acquisition, we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that may require us to pay additional consideration to the sellers for achieving certain net revenue, gross profit and EBITDA targets in 2025 and 2026 that exceed our base financial projections for the business implied in the upfront purchase price. The other contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value within long-term liabilities. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and recorded in other liabilities. Significant assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the liability include financial projections for net revenue, gross profit, and EBITDA, as well as discount and volatility rates. Fair value adjustments are primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings. 
(2)The other contingent consideration liabilities are recorded at fair value, with $93 million and $132 million classified as other current liabilities at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Fair value adjustments are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings. Payment is expected to be made in the third quarter of 2024, and the majority will be classified within cash flows provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Employer Contributions

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we contributed $1 million to our U.S. pension plans and $52 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. We make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local funding arrangements and statutory minimum funding requirements. Discretionary contributions are made to the extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability.
As of June 30, 2024, we plan to make further contributions of approximately $3 million to our U.S. plans and $26 million to our non-U.S. plans for the remainder of 2024. Our actual contributions may be different due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

Multiemployer Pension Plans

On July 11, 2019, we received an undiscounted withdrawal liability assessment from the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund totaling $491 million requiring pro-rata monthly payments over 20 years. We began making monthly payments during the third quarter of 2019. In connection with the discounted long-term liability, we recorded accreted interest of $3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, within Interest and other expense, net in the condensed consolidated statement of earnings. As of June 30, 2024, the remaining discounted withdrawal liability was $320 million, with $16 million recorded in Other current liabilities and $304 million recorded in Long-term other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 

Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans

The net periodic postretirement (benefit)/cost was $(2) million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $(5) 

million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $(2) million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. The net periodic postemployment cost was $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and zero for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Note 11. Stock Plans

(1)Includes PSUs and DSUs. 
(2)Includes PSUs, DSUs and other stock-based awards.
(3)The actual tax benefit realized and recorded in the provision for income taxes for the tax deductions from the shares vested was zero in the three months and $7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2024.
(4)The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component and the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date for performance-based components. The Monte Carlo simulation model incorporates the probability of achieving the total shareholder return market condition. Compensation expense is recognized using the grant date fair values regardless of whether the market condition is achieved, so long as the requisite service has been provided.


Share Repurchase Program

Effective January 1, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a program authorizing the repurchase of $6.0 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately $1.6 billion of Common Stock pursuant to this authorization. Repurchases under the program are determined by management and are wholly discretionary. 
During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 15 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $70.52 per share, or an aggregate cost of approximately $1.0 billion, all of which was paid during the period except for approximately $5 million settled in July 2024. All share repurchases were funded through available cash and commercial paper issuances. As of June 30, 2024, we have approximately $3.4 billion in remaining share repurchase capacity.

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies 


Legal Proceedings

We routinely are involved in various pending or threatened legal proceedings, claims, disputes, regulatory matters and governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations arising in the ordinary course of or incidental to our business, including those noted below in this section. We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending legal matters when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For matters we have not provided for that are reasonably possible to result in an unfavorable outcome, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss or such amounts have been determined to be immaterial. At present we believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and regulatory and governmental matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, legal proceedings and regulatory and governmental matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could involve substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, and other expenditures. In addition, in matters for which conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices or requiring other equitable remedies. An unfavorable outcome might result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial position.
On April 1, 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") filed a complaint against Kraft Foods Group and Mondelēz Global LLC (“Mondelēz Global”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the "District Court") related to the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts that occurred prior to the spin-off of Kraft Foods Group. The complaint alleged that Mondelēz Global: (1) manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011; (2) violated position limit levels for wheat futures; and (3) engaged in non-competitive trades. On May 13, 2022, the District Court approved a settlement agreement between the CFTC and Mondelēz Global. The terms of the settlement, which are available in the District Court’s docket, had an immaterial impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and did not include an admission by Mondelēz Global. Several class action complaints also were filed against Mondelēz Global in the District Court by investors who copied and expanded upon the CFTC allegations in a series of private claims for monetary damages as well as injunctive, declaratory, and other unspecified relief. In June 2015, these suits were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois as case number 15-cv-2937, Harry Ploss et al. v. Kraft Foods Group, Inc. and Mondelēz Global LLC. On January 3, 2020, the District Court granted plaintiffs' request to certify a class. In November 2022, the District Court adjourned the trial date it had previously set for November 30, 2022 and ordered the parties to brief Kraft’s motions to decertify the class and for summary judgment, which has been completed. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters; however, based on our Separation and Distribution Agreement with Kraft Foods Group dated as of September 27, 2012, we expect to bear any monetary penalties or other payments in connection with the class action.
As previously disclosed, in November 2019, the European Commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of European Union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. As previously disclosed, we have been cooperating with the investigation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we had accrued (in accordance with U.S. GAAP), on a pre-tax basis, a liability of €300 million ($321 million) within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of earnings as an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we adjusted our accrual to a liability of €340 million ($375 million). In the second quarter of 2024, we reached a 

negotiated resolution in this matter and adjusted our accrual from a liability of €340 million to €337.5 million ($362 million), on a pre-tax basis. Pursuant to the agreed settlement, we plan to make payment in August 2024. We do not anticipate any modification of our business practices and agreements that would have a material impact on our ongoing business operations within the European Union.

Third-Party Guarantees

We enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.

Tax Matters

We are a party to various tax matter proceedings incidental to our business. These proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable outcomes could subject us to additional tax liabilities and could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial position.


Note 13. Reclassifications from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 

The following table summarizes the changes in accumulated balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings/(losses) attributable to Mondelēz International.

Note 14. Income Taxes

As of the second quarter of 2024, our estimated annual effective tax rate, which excludes discrete tax impacts, was 27.8%. This rate reflected the impact of unfavorable foreign provisions under U.S. tax laws as well as the net unfavorable impact attributable to jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income and applicable tax rates. Our 2024 second quarter effective tax rate was 34.7% and includes discrete tax impacts in connection with unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities. Excluding these impacts, our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was 28.5%. The 28.5% reflects the impact of unfavorable foreign provisions under U.S. tax laws as well as the net unfavorable impact attributable to jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income and applicable tax rates. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 of 26.2% also includes discrete tax impacts in connection with unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities. Excluding these impacts, our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 27.2%. The 27.2% reflects the impact of unfavorable foreign provisions under U.S. tax laws as well as the net unfavorable impact attributable to jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income and applicable tax rates. 
As of the second quarter of 2023, our estimated annual effective tax rate, which excluded discrete tax impacts, was 24.6%. This rate reflected the impact of unfavorable foreign provisions under U.S. tax laws partially offset by favorable impacts from the mix of pre-tax income as well as applicable tax rates in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our 2023 second quarter effective tax rate of 23.1% included a net tax benefit related to gains and losses on KDP marketable securities and a net tax expense incurred in connection with unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities as well as other discrete net tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2023 of 27.3% was higher due to a $127 million net tax expense incurred in connection with the KDP share sale during the first quarter (the earnings are reported separately on our statement of earnings and thus not included in earnings before income taxes). Excluding this impact, our effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was 23.6%. The 23.6% rate also included net tax expense related to gains and losses on KDP marketable securities as well as the associated pre-tax impacts.

Note 16. Segment Reporting 

We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, as well as gum & candy, cheese & grocery and powdered beverages. We manage our global business and report operating results through geographic units. We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.
Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments: 

    • Latin America 


    • AMEA


    • Europe 


    • North America

We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangibles, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews.
Our reconciliation of segment net revenues and earnings to consolidated financial statement totals were:

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


Overview of Business and Strategy

Our core business is making and selling chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, with additional businesses in adjacent, locally relevant categories including gum & candy, cheese & grocery and powdered beverages around the world.
We aim to be the global leader in snacking. Our strategy is to drive long-term growth by focusing on four strategic priorities: accelerating consumer-centric growth, driving operational excellence, creating a winning growth culture and scaling sustainable snacking. We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our attractive global footprint, strong core of iconic global and local brands, marketing, sales, distribution and cost excellence capabilities, and top talent with a growth mindset, will drive consistent top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. 

Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability

Macroeconomic environment
We continue to observe significant market and geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating consumer demand, inflationary pressures, supply constraints and exchange rate volatility. As a result, we experienced significantly higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, labor and energy costs that have continued to rise. In particular, we expect to continue to face higher cocoa costs, as the market price for cocoa beans has increased significantly year-over-year and it is likely that prices will remain elevated for some time. Refer to Commodity Trends for additional information.
Our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong; however, we anticipate ongoing volatility. We will continue to proactively manage our business in response to the evolving global economic environment, related uncertainty and business risks while also prioritizing and supporting our employees and customers. We continue to take steps to mitigate impacts to our supply chain, operations, technology and assets.

War in Ukraine

In February 2022, following the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, we stopped production and closed our facilities in Ukraine; since then we have taken steps to protect the safety of our employees and to fully restore operations at our two manufacturing facilities, which were significantly damaged in March 2022. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation - War in Ukraine, to the condensed consolidated financial statements, and refer to Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results for additional information.
We have suspended new capital investments and our advertising spending in Russia, but as a food company with more than 2,500 employees in the country, we have not ceased operations given we believe we play a role in the continuity of the food supply. We continue to evaluate the situation in Ukraine and Russia and our ability to control our operating activities and businesses on an ongoing basis and comply with applicable international sanctions. We continue to consolidate both our Ukrainian and Russian subsidiaries. During the second quarter of 2024, Ukraine generated 0.4% and Russia generated 2.9% of consolidated net revenue and during the second quarter of 2023, Ukraine generated 0.3% and Russia generated 2.8% of consolidated net revenue. The profitability of and the assets held by our Russian business continue to remain above historical levels. We cannot predict if the recent performance of our Russian business will continue in the future. 
Our operations in Russia are subject to risks, including the temporary or permanent loss of assets due to expropriation or further curtailment of our ability to conduct business operations in Russia. In the event this were to occur, this could lead to the partial or full impairment of our Russian assets or deconsolidation of the operations in Russia in future periods, or the termination of our business operations, based on actions taken by Russia, other parties or us. For additional information, see the risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the risk entitled “The war in Ukraine has impacted and could continue to impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.”


Developments in the Middle East

In October 2023, conflict developed in the Middle East between Hamas and Israel, and has expanded to other parts of the region. In the second quarter of 2024, we experienced sales impacts related to this conflict in certain AMEA markets, but this did not have a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We continue to evaluate the impacts of these developments on our business and we cannot predict if it will have a significant impact in the future.

ERP System Implementation

In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved funding of $1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply chain systems (the “ERP System Implementation”). The ERP System Implementation spending comprises both capital expenditures and operating expenses, of which a majority is expected to relate to operating expenses. The operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented by region in several phases with spending occurring over the next five years, with expected completion by year-end 2028. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information. 

Extreme Price Growth in Argentina

During December 2023, the Argentinean peso significantly devalued. The peso's devaluation and potential resulting distortion on our non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other constant currency growth rate measures resulted in our decision to exclude the impact of pricing in excess of 26% year-over-year ("extreme pricing") in Argentina, from these measures beginning in Q1 2024. The benchmark of 26% represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year over a 3-year period which would result in a cumulative inflation rate in excess of 100%, the level at which an economy is considered hyperinflationary under U.S. GAAP. Throughout the following MD&A discussion, we now exclude, on a prospective basis, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Revenue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding adjustment in changes in currency translation rates. Additionally within the MD&A discussion, "currency-related items" totals the impact of extreme pricing and the currency translation rate changes. Refer to Non-GAAP financial measures for additional information. 
Currency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as follows:
•Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfavorable currency-related items of $216 million (2.6pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $544 million (6.5pp), partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of $328 million (3.9pp). In Emerging Markets, unfavorable currency-related items of $193 million (5.9pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $521 million (15.8pp), partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of $328 million (9.9pp). In Developed Markets, unfavorable currency-related items of $23 million (0.4pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes.
•Adjusted Operating Income: Unfavorable currency-related items of $57 million were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $119 million, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of $62 million.
•Adjusted EPS: Unfavorable currency-related items of $0.04 were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $0.08, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of $0.04.
Currency-related items impacted our non-GAAP financial measures for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as follows:
•Organic Net Revenue: In total, unfavorable currency-related items of $348 million (2.0pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $1,057 million (6.1pp), partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of $709 million (4.1pp). In Emerging Markets, unfavorable currency-related items of $359 million (5.2pp) were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $1,068 million (15.5pp), partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of $709 million (10.3pp). In Developed Markets, favorable currency-related items of $11 million (0.1pp) were driven by favorable currency translation rate changes.

•Adjusted Operating Income: Unfavorable currency-related items of $127 million were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $309 million, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of $182 million.
•Adjusted EPS: Unfavorable currency-related items of $0.07 were driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes of $0.21, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing of $0.14.

Divestitures

In 2022, we announced our intention to divest our developed market gum and global Halls candy businesses and in the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced an agreement to sell the developed market gum business. On October 1, 2023, we completed the sale of our developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle Group, excluding the Portugal business which we retained pending regulatory approval. We completed the sale of the Portugal business to Perfetti Van Melle Group on October 23, 2023. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures, for additional details.

Investment Transactions


Keurig Dr Pepper Transactions (Nasdaq: "KDP")

During the first quarter of 2023, we sold approximately 30 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership interest to 3.2%. We recorded a pre-tax gain on equity method transactions of $493 million (or $368 million after-tax). Our reduction in ownership to below 5% resulted in a change of accounting from equity method investment accounting to accounting for equity interests with readily determinable fair values ("marketable securities"). On June 8, 2023, we sold 23 million shares of KDP, which reduced our ownership to 1.6%. Subsequently in 2023, we sold the remainder of our shares of KDP and exited our investment in the company.
JDE Peet’s Transactions (Euronext Amsterdam: “JDEP”)
During the first quarter of 2024, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in JDEP, resulting in an impairment charge of €612 million ($665 million). During the first quarter of 2023, we sold approximately 7.7 million shares of JDEP, which reduced our ownership to 18.1%. We recorded a loss of €18 million ($19 million) on this sale.

For additional information, refer to Note 6, Investments and Note 9, Financial Instruments.


Taxes

We continue to monitor existing and potential future tax reform around the world. As of June 30, 2024, numerous countries have now enacted the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development’s model rules on a global minimum tax with the earliest effective date being for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023. Based on the guidance available thus far, we do not expect this legislation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but we will continue to evaluate it as additional guidance and clarification becomes available.

Financial Outlook

We seek to achieve profitable, long-term growth and manage our business to attain this goal using our key operating metrics: Organic Net Revenue, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS. We use these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations, particularly growth in profit dollars, to evaluate and manage our business and to plan and make near- and long-term operating and strategic decisions. As such, we believe these metrics are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information in addition to our U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") financial results. We believe it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that we use internally to make comparisons of our historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and evaluate our business. We believe our non-GAAP financial measures should always be considered in relation to our U.S. GAAP results. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and Consolidated Results of Operations for the respective reconciliations.
In addition to monitoring our key operating metrics, we monitor developments and trends that could impact our revenue and profitability objectives, as highlighted in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 


Summary of Results

•Net revenues decreased 1.9% to $8.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 and decreased 0.2% to $17.6 billion in the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
–Net revenue decline in the second quarter of 2024 was driven by unfavorable currency-related items, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year, unfavorable volume/mix and the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business, partially offset by higher net pricing.
–Net revenue decline in the first six months of 2024 was driven by unfavorable volume/mix, unfavorable currency-related items, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to most currencies we operate in compared to exchange rates in the prior year and the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business, partially offset by higher net pricing and incremental net revenue from a short-term distributor agreement related to the sale of our developed market gum business.
•Organic Net Revenue, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 2.5% to $8.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024 and increased 3.4% to $18.0 billion in the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. During both the second quarter and first six months of 2024, Organic Net Revenue grew due to higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Organic Net Revenue is on a constant currency basis and excludes revenue from acquisitions and divestitures. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the definition of Organic Net Revenue and Consolidated Results of Operations for our reconciliation with net revenues.
•Diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International decreased (34.8)% to $0.45 in the second quarter of 2024 and decreased (32.3)% to $1.49 in the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. 
–Diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter of 2024, driven by an unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivatives, lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, unfavorable initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and higher equity method investee items. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EPS, lapping prior-year losses on marketable securities and equity method investment transactions, lower loss on remeasurement of net monetary position and lower divestiture-related costs. 
–Diluted EPS decreased in the first six months of 2024, driven by an impairment charge on our JDEP equity method investment in 2024, lapping prior-year net gains on marketable securities and equity method investment transactions primarily related to our former KDP investment, lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, unfavorable initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher costs incurred from our Simplify to Grow program and higher equity method investee items. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase in Adjusted EPS, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market impacts from commodity and currency derivatives, lower divestiture-related costs and lower loss on remeasurement of net monetary position.

•Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased 19.4% to $0.86 in the second quarter of 2024 and increased 15.9% to $1.82 in the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EPS increased 25.0% to $0.90 in the second quarter of 2024 and increased 20.4% to $1.89 in the first six months of 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures for the definition of Adjusted EPS and Consolidated Results of Operations for our reconciliation with diluted EPS.

–Adjusted EPS increased in the second quarter of 2024, driven by operating gains, lower interest expense and fewer shares outstanding, partially offset by unfavorable currency-related items and higher taxes.
–Adjusted EPS increased in the first six months of 2024, driven by operating gains, lower interest expense, fewer shares outstanding and higher benefit plan non-service income, partially offset by unfavorable currency-related items, higher taxes and lapping prior year dividend income related to our former KDP investment.

Net revenue decrease of 1.9% was driven by unfavorable currency-related items and the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 2.5%. Currency-related items decreased net revenues by $216 million, driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability for additional information. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to several currencies, primarily the Argentinean peso, as well as the Nigerian naira, Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, euro and Chinese yuan, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Mexican peso, British pound sterling, Polish zloty and Colombian peso. The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $157 million for the second quarter of 2024. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures, for additional information. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the first six months of 2024. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was driven by volume declines, due to expected customer price negotiation disruptions in Europe, softer consumer demand in the U.S. and Mexico, and geopolitical impacts in parts of AMEA, which were partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was reflected across all regions.

Operating Income – Operating income decreased $571 million (40.1%) to $854 million in the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $223 million (17.6%) to $1,492 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $280 million (22.1%) to $1,549 million due to the following:

During the second quarter of 2024, we realized higher net pricing, which was partially offset by increased input costs and unfavorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the first six months of 2024, was reflected across all regions. The decrease in input costs was driven by lower manufacturing costs due to productivity, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower energy, edible oils, dairy, grains and packaging costs. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was due to volume declines partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was experienced in all regions. 
Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22 million from the second quarter of 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the elimination of costs from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, lower divestiture-related costs, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position and a favorable currency translation impact related to expenses, partially offset by higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $79 million from the second quarter of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities.
Unfavorable currency-related items, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased operating income by $57 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Egyptian pound, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, euro and Chinese yuan, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Mexican peso, British pound sterling and Polish zloty.
Operating income margin decreased from 16.8% in the second quarter of 2023 to 10.2% in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by the unfavorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activities, the impact from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program and higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program, partially offset by higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, lower divestiture-related costs and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.2% for the second quarter of 2023 to 17.9% for the second quarter of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and overhead cost leverage, partially offset by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher raw material costs.

Net revenue decrease of 0.2% was driven by unfavorable currency-related items and the impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business, partially offset by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 3.4% and the impact of a short-term distributor agreement. Currency-related items decreased net revenues by $348 million, driven by unfavorable currency translation rate changes, partially offset by the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina. Refer to Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability for additional information. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, primarily the Argentinean peso, as well as the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Nigerian naira, Chinese yuan, Egyptian pound and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the Mexican peso, British pound sterling, Polish zloty and Colombian peso. The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $304 million for the first six months of 2024. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures, for additional information. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the first six months of 2024. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was driven by volume declines, due to expected customer price negotiation disruptions in Europe, softer consumer demand in the U.S. and Mexico and geopolitical impacts in parts of AMEA, which were partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix 

was reflected across all regions. The short-term distributor agreement related to the October 1, 2023 sale of our developed market gum business added incremental net revenues of $25 million for the first six months of 2024.
Operating Income – Operating income increased $651 million (22.2%) to $3,581 million in the first six months of 2024. Adjusted Operating Income (1) increased $409 million (14.6%) to $3,202 million and Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (1) increased $536 million (19.2%) to $3,329 million due to the following:

During the first six months of 2024, we realized higher net pricing, which was partially offset by increased input costs and unfavorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing, which included the carryover impact of pricing actions taken in 2023 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the first six months of 2024, was reflected across all regions. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity. Higher raw material costs were in part due to higher cocoa, sugar, nuts and other ingredient costs, as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower dairy, energy, edible oils, grains and packaging costs. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix was due to volume declines partially offset by favorable product mix. Unfavorable volume/mix was experienced in all regions.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased $105 million from the first six months of 2023, which was net of benefits from a number of factors noted in the table above, including in part, the elimination of costs from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, lower divestiture-related costs, lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position and a favorable currency translation impact related to expenses, marginally offset by costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program, higher implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program and lower acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. Excluding these factors, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $217 million from the first six months of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher overhead costs in part due to increased investments in route to market capabilities.
Unfavorable currency changes, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, decreased operating income by $127 million primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Chinese yuan, Egyptian pound, Nigerian naira and Australian dollar, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, Mexican peso and Polish zloty.
Operating income margin increased from 16.6% in the first six months of 2023 to 20.3% in the first six months of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher Adjusted Operating Income margin, favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from commodity and currency hedging activities, lower divestiture-related costs and lower remeasurement loss of net monetary position, partially offset by the impact from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program and costs incurred for the ERP System Implementation program. Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 16.1% for the first six months of 2023 to 18.2% for the first six months of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs driven by productivity and overhead leverage, partially offset by higher raw material costs and higher advertising and consumer promotion costs.

Results of Operations by Reportable Segment

Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments:

•Latin America

•AMEA
•Europe

•North America

We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions.
We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. See Note 16, Segment Reporting, for additional information on our segments and Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results earlier in this section for items affecting our segment operating results.

Overall, unfavorable volume/mix reflected consumer softness in the U.S. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits & baked snacks and candy, partially offset by a gain in chocolate. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes were due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. 
Segment operating income decreased $35 million (6.0%), primarily due to lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments and unfavorable volume/mix. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and lower divestiture-related costs.

Six Months Ended June 30:

Net revenues decreased $150 million (2.8%), due to the impact of divestitures (3.6 pp) and unfavorable volume/mix (1.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.4 pp). The impact of our 2023 divestiture of the developed market gum business resulted in a year-over-year reduction in net revenues of $190 million. Overall, unfavorable volume/mix reflected consumer softness in the U.S. Unfavorable volume/mix was driven by declines in biscuits & baked snacks and candy, partially offset by a gain in chocolate. Higher net pricing, driven by input cost-driven pricing actions, was reflected across all categories. 
Segment operating income decreased $52 million (4.5%), primarily due to lapping prior-year operating results from the developed market gum business divested in 2023, higher raw material costs, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and unfavorable volume/mix. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs due to productivity, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses, lower fixed asset impairment charges and lower divestiture-related costs.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe that cash from operations, our revolving credit facilities, short-term borrowings and our authorized long-term financing will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures and future payments of our contractual, tax and benefit plan obligations and payments for acquisitions, share repurchases and quarterly dividends. We expect to continue to utilize our commercial paper program and international credit lines as needed. We continually evaluate long-term debt issuances to meet our short- and longer-term funding requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve financial flexibility. Our investment in JDE Peet's provides us additional flexibility. Overall, we do not expect negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, and we continue to monitor our global operations including the impact of ongoing or new developments in Ukraine and the Middle East. To date, we have been successful in generating cash and raising financing as needed. However, if a serious economic or credit market crisis ensues or other adverse developments arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.
Our most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for raw materials, labor, manufacturing and distribution, trade and promotions, advertising and marketing, tax liabilities, benefit plan obligations and lease expenses) as well as periodic expenditures for acquisitions, shareholder returns (such as dividend payments and share repurchases), property, plant and equipment and any significant one-time non-operating items. 
Long-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding long-term debt repayments (refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements), our U.S. tax reform transition tax liability and deferred taxes (refer to Note 16, Income Taxes, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023), our long-term benefit plan obligations (refer to Note 10, Benefit Plans, and Note 11, Benefit Plans, in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023) and commodity-related purchase commitments and derivative contracts (refer to Note 9, Financial Instruments).
We generally fund short- and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities as well as cash proceeds from short- and long-term debt financing (refer to Debt below). We generally do not use equity to fund our ongoing obligations. 

Cash Flow

We believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily access capital markets and secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths and give us significant flexibility to meet our short- and long-term financial commitments. Our cash flow activity is noted below:

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash-basis net earnings, largely due to operating gains, partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year working capital movements.

Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Investing Activities

The reduction in net cash used in/provided by investing activities was largely driven by lapping prior year proceeds from the KDP and JDEP share sales (refer to Note 6, Investments) combined with higher capital expenditures. We continue to make capital expenditures primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities, implement new product manufacturing and support productivity initiatives. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be up to $1.5 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our Simplify to Grow Program and for funding our strategic priorities. We expect to continue to fund these expenditures with cash from operations.


Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

The decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to higher debt proceeds combined with lower debt repayments, partially offset by higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid in the first six months of 2024 compared to the same prior year period.

Dividends

We paid dividends of $1,151 million in the first six months of 2024 and $1,055 million in the first six months of 2023. The second quarter 2024 dividend of $0.425 per share, declared on May 22, 2024 for shareholders of record as of June 28, 2024, was paid on July 12, 2024. On July 30, 2024, the Audit Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.470 per share of Class A Common Stock, an increase of 11 percent. This dividend is payable on October 14, 2024, to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2024. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
We anticipate that the 2024 distributions will be characterized as dividends under U.S. federal income tax rules. The final determination will be made on an IRS Form 1099–DIV issued in early 2025.

Guarantees

As discussed in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.

Debt

The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of financing throughout the year to meet our short-term working capital or other financing needs.
At its December 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors approved a new $2 billion long-term financing authorization that replaced the prior long-term financing authorization of $2 billion. As of June 30, 2024, $1.45 billion of the long-term financing authorization remained available.
Our total debt was $19.8 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $19.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.42 at June 30, 2024 and 0.41 at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 7.4 years. Our average daily commercial paper borrowings outstanding were $0.9 billion in the first six months of 2024 and $3 billion in the first six months of 2023. 
One of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), has outstanding debt. The operations held by MIHN generated approximately 72.7% (or $12.8 billion) of the $17.6 billion of consolidated net revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The operations held by MIHN represented approximately 78.7% (or $21.8 billion) of the $27.7 billion of net assets as of June 30, 2024.

Refer to Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements, for additional information on our debt and debt covenants.


Commodity Trends

We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel required for production. During the first six months of 2024, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher cocoa, sugar, nuts, and other ingredient costs, as well as unfavorable year-over-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower, dairy, energy, edible oils, grains and packaging costs. While the costs of our principal raw materials fluctuate, generally we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will broadly remain available.
A number of external factors such as the current macroeconomic environment, including global inflation, effects of geopolitical uncertainty, climate and weather conditions, commodity, transportation and labor market conditions, 

exchange rate volatility and the effects of local and global regulations, governmental agricultural or other programs affect the availability and cost of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. In particular, the supply of cocoa is exposed to many of these factors, including climate change and weather events, local regulations in cocoa-producing countries, and global regulations such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (which requires companies to ensure that the products they place on the EU market or export from it are not associated with deforestation). These factors could impact the supply of cocoa, which could potentially limit our ability to produce our products and significantly impact profitability.
During the first six months of 2024, price volatility and the higher aggregate cost environment increased due to international supply chain and labor market disruptions and generally higher commodity, transportation and labor costs. We expect these conditions to continue to impact our aggregate commodity costs. In particular, we expect to face higher cocoa costs in the near- and medium-term due to these factors. For example, the market price for cocoa beans on the Intercontinental Exchange in London was 175% higher on the last trading day of the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same day in the second quarter of 2023 and it is likely that prices will remain elevated for some time. It is possible that we may not be able to increase prices sufficiently to fully cover the incremental costs of cocoa prices in this environment and/or our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in cocoa costs, which could result in a significant impact on our profitability. 
We address higher commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging techniques to limit the impact of fluctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity cost changes, such as dairy, where there is a limited ability to hedge, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible future price decreases. Additionally, our costs for major raw materials will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices. Due to competitive or market conditions, planned trade or promotional incentives, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost changes temporarily.

Significant Accounting Estimates

We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, respectively, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Also refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, in this report.

Forward-Looking Statements

Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Important factors 

that could cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those contained in or implied by our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:
•weakness in macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of inflation (and related monetary policy actions by governments in response to inflation) and the instability of certain financial institutions; 
•volatility of commodity and other input costs and availability of commodities, including but not limited to cocoa; 
•geopolitical uncertainty, including the impact of ongoing or new developments in Ukraine and the Middle East, related current and future sanctions imposed by governments and other authorities and related impacts, including on our business operations, employees, reputation, brands, financial condition and results of operations;
•competition and our response to channel shifts and pricing and other competitive pressures; 
•pricing actions and customer and consumer responses to such actions;
•promotion and protection of our reputation and brand image; 
•weakness in consumer spending and/or changes in consumer preferences and demand and our ability to predict, identify, interpret and meet these changes;
•risks from operating globally, including in emerging markets, such as political, economic and regulatory risks; 
•the outcome and effects on us of legal and tax proceedings and government investigations, including the European Commission legal matter;
•use of information technology and third party service providers;
•unanticipated disruptions to our business, such as malware incidents, cyberattacks or other security breaches, and supply, commodity, labor and transportation constraints; 
•our ability to identify, complete, implement, manage and realize the full extent of the benefits, cost savings, efficiencies and/or synergies presented by strategic transactions and initiatives, such as our ERP System Implementation program; 
•our investments and our ownership interests in those investments, including JDE Peet's;
•the restructuring program and our other transformation initiatives not yielding the anticipated benefits; 
•changes in the assumptions on which the restructuring program is based; 
•the impact of climate change on our supply chain and operations; 
•global or regional health pandemics or epidemics;
•consolidation of retail customers and competition with retailer and other economy brands; 
•changes in our relationships with customers, suppliers or distributors; 
•management of our workforce and shifts in labor availability or labor costs; 
•compliance with legal, regulatory, tax and benefit laws and related changes, claims or actions; 
•perceived or actual product quality issues or product recalls; 
•failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures; 
•our ability to protect our intellectual property and intangible assets;
•tax matters including changes in tax laws and rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes; 
•changes in currency exchange rates, controls and restrictions; 
•volatility of and access to capital or other markets, rising interest rates, the effectiveness of our cash management programs and our liquidity; 
•pension costs; 
•significant changes in valuation factors that may adversely affect our impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets; and 
•the risks and uncertainties, as they may be amended from time to time, set forth in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
There may be other factors not presently known to us or which we currently consider to be immaterial that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make. We disclaim and do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement in this report except as required by applicable law or regulation. In addition, historical, current and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future.


Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use non-GAAP financial information and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in our underlying operating results and provide additional insight and transparency on how we evaluate our business. We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate our performance. We have detailed the non-GAAP adjustments that we make in our non-GAAP definitions below. The adjustments generally fall within the following categories: acquisition and divestiture activities, gains and losses on intangible asset sales and non-cash impairments, major program restructuring activities, constant currency and related adjustments, major program financing and hedging activities and other major items affecting comparability of operating results. We believe the non-GAAP measures should always be considered along with the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have provided the reconciliations between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures along with a discussion of our underlying GAAP results throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-Q.
Our primary non-GAAP financial measures are listed below and reflect how we evaluate our current and prior-year operating results. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When our definitions change, we provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis (1).
•“Organic Net Revenue” is defined as net revenues (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures (2), short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of business (3) and currency rate fluctuations (4). We believe that Organic Net Revenue reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business and provides improved comparability of results. We also evaluate Organic Net Revenue growth from emerging markets and developed markets, and these underlying measures are also reconciled to U.S. GAAP above. 

•Our emerging markets include our Latin America region in its entirety; the AMEA region, excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan; and the following countries from the Europe region: Russia, Ukraine, Türkiye, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Baltics and the East Adriatic countries. 

•Our developed markets include the entire North America region, the Europe region excluding the countries included in the emerging markets definition, and Australia, New Zealand and Japan from the AMEA region.
•“Adjusted Operating Income” is defined as operating income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) excluding the impacts of the Simplify to Grow Program (5); gains or losses (including non-cash impairment charges) on goodwill and intangible assets; divestiture (2) or acquisition gains or losses, divestiture-related costs (6), acquisition-related costs (7), and acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments (8); inventory step-up charges (9); the operating results of divestitures (2); operating results from short-term distributor agreements related to the sale of a business (3); remeasurement of net monetary position (10); mark-to-market impacts from commodity, forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative contracts (11); impact from resolution of tax matters (12); 2017 malware incident net recoveries; incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine (13); impact from the European Commission legal matter (14); the impact from pension participation changes (15); and operating costs from the ERP System Implementation program (16). We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income. We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis (4). We believe these measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.
•“Adjusted EPS” is defined as diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International (the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) from continuing operations excluding the impacts of the items listed in the Adjusted Operating Income definition as well as losses on debt extinguishment and related expenses; gains or losses on interest rate swaps no longer designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed financing and hedging plans; mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities (17); initial impacts from enacted tax law changes (18); and gains or losses on equity method investment transactions including impairments. Similarly, within Adjusted EPS, our equity method 

investment net earnings exclude our proportionate share of our investee's significant operating and non-operating items (19). We also evaluate growth in our Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis (4). We believe Adjusted EPS provides improved comparability of underlying operating results.
(1)When items no longer impact our current or future presentation of non-GAAP operating results, we remove these items from our non-GAAP definitions. Beginning in Q1 2024, due to a significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso that occurred in December 2023 and the resulting distortion it would cause on our non-GAAP constant currency growth rate measures, we now exclude the impact of pricing in excess of 26% year-over-year ("extreme pricing") in Argentina, which is the level at which hyperinflation generally occurs cumulatively over a 3-year period. We have excluded the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from our calculation of Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding adjustment to changes in currency exchange rates. We made this change on a prospective basis due to the distorting effect expected in the current period and future periods following the Argentinian peso devaluation that occurred in December 2023 and did not revise our historical non-GAAP constant currency growth measures. Beginning in Q2 2024, we added to the non-GAAP definitions the exclusion of operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation program as they represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations (see footnote (16) below).
(2)Divestitures include completed sales of businesses, exits of major product lines upon completion of a sale or licensing agreement, the partial or full sale of an equity method investment and changes from equity method investment accounting to accounting for marketable securities. As we record our share of JDE Peet’s ongoing earnings on a one-quarter lag basis, any JDE Peet’s ownership reductions are reflected as divestitures within our non-GAAP results the following quarter. 
(3)In the fourth quarter of 2023, we began to exclude the operating results from short-term distributor agreements that have been executed in conjunction with the sale of a business. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(4)Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we also now include within our currency-related impacts a corresponding adjustment associated with the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina.
(5)Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments. 
(6)Divestiture-related costs, which includes costs incurred in relation to the preparation and completion (including one-time costs such as severance related to elimination of stranded costs) of our divestitures as defined in footnote (2), also includes costs incurred associated with our publicly announced processes to sell businesses. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(7)Acquisition-related costs, which includes transaction costs such as third party advisor, investment banking and legal fees, also includes one-time compensation expense related to the buyout of non-vested ESOP shares and realized gains or losses from hedging activities associated with acquisition funds. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(8)Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments include one-time costs related to the integration of acquisitions as well as any adjustments made to the fair market value of contingent compensation liabilities that have been previously booked for earn-outs related to acquisitions that do not relate to recurring employee compensation expense. We exclude these items to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(9)In the third quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the one-time inventory step-up charges associated with acquired companies related to the fair market valuation of the acquired inventory. We exclude this item to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(10)In connection with our applying highly inflationary accounting (refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation) for Argentina (beginning in the third quarter of 2018) and Türkiye (beginning in the second quarter of 2022), we exclude the related remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities denominated in the local currency to the U.S. dollar during the periods presented and the realized gains and losses from derivatives that mitigate the foreign currency volatility related to the remeasurement of the respective net monetary assets or liabilities during the periods presented.
(11)We exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivatives from our non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.

(12)See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, in this report, and Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

(13)In February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine and we stopped our production and closed our facilities in Ukraine for a period of time due to damage incurred to our facilities during the invasion. We began to incur incremental costs directly related to the war including asset impairments, such as property and inventory losses, higher expected allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and committed compensation. We have isolated and exclude these costs and related impacts as well as subsequent recoveries from our operating results to facilitate evaluation and comparisons of our ongoing results. Incremental costs related to increasing operations in other primarily European facilities are not included with these costs. 
(14)In the fourth quarter of 2022, we began to exclude the impact from the European Commission legal matter. In November 2019, the European Commission informed us that it initiated an investigation into our alleged infringement of European Union competition law through certain practices allegedly restricting cross-border trade within the European Economic Area. On January 28, 2021, the European Commission announced it had taken the next procedural step in its investigation and opened formal proceedings. We have been cooperating with the investigation and are currently engaged in discussions with the European Commission in an effort to reach a negotiated, proportionate resolution to this matter. As of December 31. 2022, we recorded an estimate of the possible cost to resolve this matter. Due to the unique nature of this matter, we believe it to be infrequent and 

unusual and therefore exclude it to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information.
(15)The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 10, Benefit Plans, for additional information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.
(16)In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved funding of $1.2 billion for a multi-year systems transformation program to upgrade our global ERP and supply chain systems (the “ERP System Implementation”), which is comprised of both capital expenditures and operating expenses, of which a majority is expected to be operating expenses. The ERP System Implementation program will be implemented in several phases with spending occurring over the next five years, with expected completion by year-end 2028. The operating expenses associated with the ERP System Implementation represent incremental transformational costs above the normal ongoing level of spending on information technology to support operations. These expenses include third-party consulting fees, direct labor costs associated with the program, accelerated depreciation of our existing SAP financial systems and various other expenses, all associated with the implementation of our information technology upgrades. These operating expenses will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures as they are nonrecurring and excluding those costs will better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. Costs incurred in the second quarter represent preliminary planning costs.
(17)In the first quarter of 2023, we began to exclude mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses, as well as realized gains or losses, associated with our marketable securities from our non-GAAP earnings measures. These marketable securities gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and are excluded to better facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods.
(18)We have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. Initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 U.S. tax reform. We exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes. 
(19)We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees’ significant operating and non-operating items such as acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelēz International from continuing operations” includes all of the investees’ significant operating and non-operating items.
We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-Q, which can be found above under Consolidated Results of Operations.


Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

As we operate globally, we are primarily exposed to currency exchange rate, commodity price and interest rate market risks. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results. 
We principally utilize derivative instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from volatility in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Additionally, we periodically use interest rate swaps and forward interest rate contracts to achieve a desired proportion of variable versus fixed rate debt based on current and projected market conditions. For additional information on our derivative activity and the types of derivative instruments we use to hedge our currency exchange, commodity price and interest rate exposures, see Note 9, Financial Instruments and for additional information on our debt activity, see Note 8, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements.
For additional information on our strategies, policies and practices on an ongoing basis, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.


Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
