Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure.

 

On July 15, 2024, Duke Energy Florida, LLC (“DEF”) filed a Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement”) with the Florida Public Service Commission (“FPSC”). The parties to the Settlement include DEF, the Office of Public Counsel, and other intervening parties (collectively, the “Parties.”)

 
Pursuant to the Settlement, the Parties agreed to a base rate stay-out provision that expires year-end 2027; however, DEF is allowed an increase to its base rates in 2025 and 2026, as well as utilization of certain tax benefits in lieu of a revenue increase in 2027. Additionally, revenue increases related to solar investments will be recovered via the Solar Base Rate Adjustment (“SOBRA”) mechanism.
 
The Parties also agreed to a return on equity (“ROE”) band of 9.3% to 11.3% with a midpoint of 10.3% based on a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt.
 

The Settlement is subject to the review and approval of the FPSC.

 
An overview providing additional detail on the Settlement is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1. The information in Exhibit 99.1 is being furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01 and shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.
