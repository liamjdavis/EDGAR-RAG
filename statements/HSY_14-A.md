THE HERSHEY COMPANY


NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)



1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 


Basis of Presentation 

The unaudited consolidated financial statements provided in this report include the accounts of The Hershey Company (the “Company,” “Hershey,” “we” or “us”) and our majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we have a controlling financial interest after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. We have a controlling financial interest if we own a majority of the outstanding voting common stock and minority shareholders do not have substantive participating rights, we have significant control through contractual or economic interests in which we are the primary beneficiary or we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance. We use the equity method of accounting when we have a 20% to 50% interest in other companies and exercise significant influence. Other investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method. Both equity method investments and cost, less impairment, investments are included as Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial reporting and with the rules and regulations for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not contain certain information and disclosures required by GAAP for comprehensive financial statements. The financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in our opinion, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for the indicated periods.
Operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 because of seasonal effects on our business. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (our “2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”), which provides a more complete understanding of our accounting policies, financial position, operating results and other matters.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements


Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. This ASU requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the program including the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude. ASU 2022-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those annual periods. A rollforward of obligations during the annual period, including the amount of obligations confirmed and obligations subsequently paid, is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 with early adoption permitted. This ASU should be applied retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. We early adopted provisions of this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the exception of the amendment on rollforward information, which we adopted in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods within those annual periods. This ASU should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the date of adoption. As a result, we adopted the provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2023. This new standard was not applicable to the May 2023 acquisition of Weaver Popcorn Manufacturing, Inc. (“Weaver”) due to no contract assets or liabilities being acquired in this transaction (as discussed in Note 2); however, it will be applied in relevant future acquisitions.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), an amount for other segment items with a description of the composition, and disclosure of the title and position of the CODM. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the update should be applied retrospectively to each period presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, we intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires public business entities on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in a tabular rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a five percent quantitative threshold. Additionally, the ASU requires all entities to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as well as individual jurisdictions where income taxes paid are equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the update should be applied on a prospective basis, with a retrospective application permitted in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, we intend to adopt the provisions of this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2025. 
No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had or is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS


Manufacturing Capacity

On May 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets that provide additional manufacturing capacity from Weaver, a leader in the production and co-packing of microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat popcorn, and former co-manufacturer of the Company’s SkinnyPop brand. The initial cash consideration paid for Weaver totaled $165,818 and consisted of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. Acquisition-related costs for the Weaver acquisition were immaterial.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, Weaver has been included within the North America Salty Snacks segment from the date of acquisition. The purchase consideration was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values and consisted of $85,231 to goodwill, $79,136 to property, plant and equipment, net and $1,451 to other net assets acquired. The purchase price allocation has been finalized as of the fourth quarter of 2023 and did not include measurement period adjustments. 
Goodwill was determined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill derived from this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes and reflects the value of leveraging our supply chain capabilities to accelerate growth and access to our portfolio of salty snacks products.

3. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment for the six months ended June 30, 2024 are as follows:

4. SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT 


Short-term Debt

As a source of short-term financing, we utilize cash on hand and commercial paper or bank loans with an original maturity of three months or less. We maintain a $1.35 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings by an additional $500 million with the consent of the lenders. The credit facility is scheduled to expire on April 26, 2028; however, we may extend the termination date for up to two additional one-year periods upon notice to the administrative agent.
The credit agreements governing the credit facility contain certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties and events of default. As of June 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants pertaining to the credit facility, and we had no significant compensating balance agreements that legally restricted access to these funds. For more information, refer to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks. Commitment fees relating to our revolving credit facility and lines of credit are not material. Short-term debt consisted of the following:
|    |                                                                |               |           |                   |     |         |

5. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

We are exposed to market risks arising principally from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. We use certain derivative instruments to manage these risks. These include interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk, foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, and commodities futures and options contracts to manage commodity market price risk exposures.
In entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by entering into exchange-traded contracts with collateral posting requirements and/or by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults.

Commodity Price Risk

We enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments to reduce the effect of future price fluctuations associated with the purchase of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation services. We generally hedge commodity price risks for 3- to 24-month periods. Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $92,330 as of June 30, 2024 and $94,917 as of December 31, 2023.
Derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded as incurred within cost of sales. As discussed in Note 13, we define our segment income to exclude gains and losses on commodity derivatives until the related inventory is sold, at which time the related gains and losses are reflected within segment income.  This enables us to continue to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income.

Foreign Exchange Price Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and other non-functional currency transactions of certain subsidiaries. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, Brazilian real, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Swiss franc. We typically utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge these exposures for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months. The contracts are either designated as cash flow hedges or are undesignated. The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges was $32,953 at June 30, 2024 and $80,068 at December 31, 2023. The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $6,899 at June 30, 2024 and $13,665 at December 31, 2023. The change in fair value on these instruments is recorded directly in cost of sales or selling, marketing and administrative (“SM&A”) expense, depending on the nature of the underlying exposure.

Interest Rate Risk

In order to manage interest rate exposure, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. These swaps, which are settled upon issuance of the related debt, are designated as cash flow hedges and the gains and losses that are deferred in other comprehensive income are being recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings. 

Equity Price Risk

We are exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices related to our deferred compensation obligations to our employees. To mitigate this risk, we use equity swap contracts to hedge the portion of the exposure that is linked to market-level equity returns. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are entered into for periods of 3 to 12 months. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expense, together with the change in the related liabilities. The notional amount of the contracts outstanding at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $27,643 and $22,867, respectively.

(a)Gains (losses) recognized in income for non-designated commodities futures and options contracts were included in cost of sales. Gains (losses) recognized in income for non-designated foreign currency forward exchange contracts and deferred compensation derivatives were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses.
(b)Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into income for foreign currency forward exchange contracts were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Losses reclassified from AOCI into income for interest rate swap agreements were included in interest expense.
The amount of pre-tax net losses on derivative instruments, including interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward exchange contracts expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately $6,416 as of June 30, 2024. This amount is primarily associated with interest rate swap agreements.

6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Accounting guidance on fair value measurements requires that financial assets and liabilities be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories of the fair value hierarchy:|    |                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | Level 1 – Based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.                                                                          |
|  2 | Level 2 – Based on observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.                                                                |
|  3 | Level 3 – Based on unobservable inputs that reflect the entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. |
We did not have any Level 3 financial assets or liabilities, nor were there any transfers between levels during the periods presented.

(1)The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is the difference between the contract and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences.

Other Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximated fair values as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. 
The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar debt issues and is, therefore, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The fair values and carrying values of long-term debt, including the current portion, were as follows:
|    |                                   |               |           |                   |           |               |           |                   |         |    |           |         |    |           |

Other Fair Value Measurements

In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, GAAP requires that, under certain circumstances, we also record assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
In connection with the acquisition of Weaver in May 2023, as discussed in Note 2, we used valuation techniques to determine fair value, with the primary technique being the cost approach to value personal property, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy.

7. LEASES

We lease office and retail space, warehouse and distribution facilities, land, vehicles, and equipment. We determine if an agreement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term and are recognized at the lease commencement date.
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The estimated incremental borrowing rate is derived from information available at the lease commencement date.
Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. A limited number of our lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Our lease agreements generally do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
For real estate, equipment and vehicles that support selling, marketing and general administrative activities, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. These asset categories comprise the majority of our leases. The lease and non-lease components of real estate and equipment leases supporting production activities are not accounted for as a single lease component. Consideration for such contracts are allocated to the lease and non-lease components based upon relative standalone prices either observable or estimated if observable prices are not readily available.

8. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES

We invest in partnerships that make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and renewable energy tax credits. The tax credits, when realized, are recognized as a reduction of tax expense under the flow-through method, at which time the corresponding equity investment is written-down to reflect the remaining value of the future benefits to be realized. The equity investment write-down is reflected within other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 17).
Additionally, we acquire ownership interests in emerging snacking businesses and startup companies, which vary in method of accounting based on our percentage of ownership and ability to exercise significant influence over decisions relating to operating and financial affairs. These investments afford the Company the rights to distribute brands that the Company does not own to third-party customers primarily in North America. Net sales and expenses of our equity method investees are not consolidated into our financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of earnings or losses are recorded on a net basis within other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Both equity method investments and cost, less impairment, investments are reported within other non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We regularly review our investments and adjust accordingly for capital contributions, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments. Total investments in unconsolidated affiliates were $215,759 and $207,177 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

9. BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES

We periodically undertake business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business in support of our key growth strategies. 

Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative

On February 2, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board” or “Board of Directors”) approved a multi-year productivity initiative (“Advancing Agility & Automation” or "AAA") to improve supply chain and manufacturing-related spend, optimize selling, general and administrative expenses, leverage new technology and business models to further simplify and automate processes, and generate long-term savings.
The Company estimates that the AAA Initiative will result in total pre-tax costs of $200,000 to $250,000 from inception through 2026. This estimate primarily includes program office execution and third-party costs supporting the design and implementation of the new organizational structure of $100,000 to $120,000, as well as implementation and technology capability costs of $55,000 to $70,000. Additionally, we expect to incur employee severance and related separation benefits of $45,000 to $60,000 as we facilitate workforce reductions and reallocate resources to further drive the Company’s strategic priorities. The cash portion of the total cost is estimated to be $175,000 to $225,000. At the conclusion of the program in 2026, ongoing annual savings are expected to be approximately $300,000.
Since inception through June 30, 2024, we recognized total costs associated with the AAA Initiative of $55,666. These charges predominantly included third-party costs supporting the design and implementation of the new organizational structure, as well as technology capability costs. The costs and related benefits of the AAA Initiative relate to the North America Confectionery segment and Corporate. However, segment operating results do not include these business realignment expenses because we evaluate segment performance excluding such costs.

2020 International Optimization Program

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we commenced a program (“International Optimization Program”) to streamline resources and investments in select international markets, including the optimization of our China operating model that will improve our operational efficiency and provide for a strong, sustainable and simplified base going forward.
The International Optimization Program was originally expected to total pre-tax costs of $50,000 to $75,000, with cash costs in the range of $40,000 to $65,000, primarily related to workforce reductions of approximately 350 positions outside of the United States, costs to consolidate and relocate production, and third-party costs incurred to execute these activities. The costs and related benefits of the International Optimization Program relate to the International segment. However, segment operating results do not include these business realignment expenses because we evaluate

segment performance excluding such costs. For the six months ended July 2, 2023, we recognized total costs associated with the International Optimization Program of $3,866. From program inception in 2020 through completion in 2023, we incurred pre-tax charges to execute the program totaling $53,799.

Amounts classified as liabilities qualifying as exit and disposal costs primarily represent employee-related and certain third-party service provider charges; however, such amounts at June 30, 2024 are not significant.

10. INCOME TAXES 

The majority of our taxable income is generated in the United States and taxed at the United States statutory rate of 21%. The effective tax rates for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023 were 20.6% and 17.1%, respectively. Relative to the statutory rate, the 2024 effective tax rate was primarily impacted by investment tax credits partially offset by state taxes.
The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in the United States, including various state and local returns, and in other foreign jurisdictions. We are routinely audited by taxing authorities in our filing jurisdictions, and a number of these disputes are currently underway, including multi-year controversies at various stages of review, negotiation and litigation in Mexico, Canada, Switzerland and the United States. The outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, including the timing of resolution or potential settlements. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Based on our current assessments, we believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. We reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $51,111 within the next 12 months because of the expiration of statutes of limitations and settlements of tax audits.

Inflation Reduction Act

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA enacted a 15% corporate minimum tax on certain corporations and an excise tax on share repurchases after December 31, 2022, and created and extended certain energy-related tax credits and incentives. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023 the tax-related provisions of the IRA did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including our annual effective tax rate, or on our liquidity.

12. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS 

Share-based grants for compensation and incentive purposes are made pursuant to the Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (“EICP”). The EICP provides for grants of one or more of the following stock-based compensation awards to employees, non-employee directors and certain service providers upon whom the successful conduct of our business is dependent:

•Non-qualified stock options (“stock options”);
•Performance stock units (“PSUs”) and performance stock;
•Stock appreciation rights;
•Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock; and
•Other stock-based awards.
The EICP also provides for the deferral of stock-based compensation awards by participants if approved by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of our Board and if in accordance with an applicable deferred compensation plan of the Company. Currently, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee has authorized the deferral of PSU and RSU awards by certain eligible employees under the Company’s Deferred Compensation Plan. Our Board has authorized our non-employee directors to defer any portion of their cash retainer, committee chair fees and RSUs awarded that they elect to convert into deferred stock units under our Directors’ Compensation Plan.
At the time stock options are exercised or PSUs and RSUs become payable, Common Stock is issued from our accumulated treasury shares. Dividend equivalents are credited on RSUs on the same date and at the same rate as dividends paid on our Common Stock. Dividend equivalents are charged to retained earnings and included in accrued liabilities until paid.
Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, historical data is used to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
For the periods presented, compensation expense for all types of stock-based compensation programs and the related income tax benefit recognized were as follows:
|    |                              |                    |        |                  |       |               |        |              |    |        |    |        |

Compensation expenses for stock compensation plans are primarily included in SM&A expense. As of June 30, 2024, total stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $88,119 and the weighted-average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized was approximately 1.8 years. 

Stock Options 

The exercise price of each stock option awarded under the EICP equals the closing price of our Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Each stock option has a maximum term of 10 years. Grants of stock options provide for pro-rated vesting, typically over a four-year period. Expense for stock options is based on grant date fair value and recognized on a straight-line method over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures.

Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units

Under the EICP, we grant PSUs to select executives and other key employees. Vesting is contingent upon the achievement of certain performance objectives. We grant PSUs over three-year performance cycles. If we meet targets for financial measures at the end of the applicable three-year performance cycle, we award a resulting number of shares of our Common Stock to the participants. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. 
For PSUs granted, the target award is a combination of a market-based total shareholder return and performance-based components. For market-based condition components, market volatility and other factors are taken into consideration in determining the grant date fair value and the related compensation expense is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. For performance-based condition components, we estimate the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved each quarter and adjust compensation expenses accordingly. The performance scores of PSU grants during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023 can range from 0% to 250% of the targeted amounts. 
We recognize the compensation expenses associated with PSUs ratably over the three-year term. Compensation expenses are based on the grant date fair value because the grants can only be settled in shares of our Common Stock. The grant date fair value of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return component and the closing market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant for performance-based components.
During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and July 2, 2023, we awarded RSUs to certain executive officers and other key employees under the EICP. We also awarded RSUs to non-employee directors.

The Company reports its operations through three reportable segments: (i) North America Confectionery, (ii) North America Salty Snacks and (iii) International. This organizational structure aligns with how our CODM manages our business, including resource allocation and performance assessment, and further aligns with our product categories and the key markets we serve. 
•North America Confectionery – This segment is responsible for our traditional chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position in the United States and Canada. This includes our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines. This segment also includes our retail operations, including Hershey’s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain of the Company’s trademarks and products to third parties around the world.
•North America Salty Snacks – This segment is responsible for our salty snacking products in the United States. This includes ready-to-eat popcorn, baked and trans fat free snacks, pretzels and other snacks.
•International – International is a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually material, including those geographic regions where we operate outside of North America. We currently have operations and manufacture product in Mexico, Brazil, India and Malaysia, primarily for consumers in these regions, and also distribute and sell confectionery products in export markets of Asia, Latin America, Middle East, Europe, Africa and other regions.
For segment reporting purposes, we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. These items of our operating income are managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the CODM as well as the measure of segment performance used for incentive compensation purposes.
As discussed in Note 5, derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. These derivatives are recognized at fair market value with the resulting realized and unrealized (gains) losses recognized in unallocated derivative (gains) losses outside of the reporting segment results until the related inventory is sold, at which time the related gains and losses are reallocated to segment income. This enables us to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income.
Certain manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and other activities supporting our global operations are integrated to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, assets and capital expenditures are not managed on a segment basis and are not included in the information reported to the CODM for the purpose of evaluating performance or allocating resources. We disclose depreciation and amortization that is generated by segment-specific assets, since these amounts are included within the measure of segment income reported to the CODM.

As of June 30, 2024, the cumulative amount of mark-to-market gains on commodity derivatives that have been recognized in our consolidated cost of sales and not yet allocated to reportable segments was $114,437. Based on our forecasts of the timing of the recognition of the underlying hedged items, we expect to reclassify net pre-tax gains on commodity derivatives of $18,642 to segment operating results in the next twelve months.

THE HERSHEY COMPANY


NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)

In July 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase authorization to repurchase shares of our Common Stock. As a result of the February 2023 Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, the July 2018 share repurchase authorization was completed. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization, which was completed as of March 31, 2024. In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. This program commenced after the existing May 2021 authorization was completed. As a result of the share repurchase authorization, approximately $470 million remains available for repurchases under our December 2023 share repurchase authorization. We are authorized to purchase our outstanding shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions. The program has no expiration date and acquired shares of Common Stock will be held as treasury shares. Purchases under approved share repurchase authorizations are in addition to our practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans.

15. CONTINGENCIES 

The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of the ordinary course of our business, which cover a wide range of matters including trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters, human and workplace rights matters and tax. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of such proceedings and claims with certainty, in our opinion these matters, both individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

16. EARNINGS PER SHARE 

We compute basic earnings per share for Common Stock and Class B common stock using the two-class method. The Class B common stock is convertible into Common Stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. The computation of diluted earnings per share for Common Stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock using the if-converted method, while the diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.

OVERVIEW

Hershey is a global confectionery leader known for making more moments of goodness through chocolate, sweets, mints and other great tasting snacks. We are the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America, a leading snack maker in the United States (“U.S.”) and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. We market, sell and distribute our products under more than 90 brand names in approximately 80 countries worldwide.

TRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS

Throughout the first six months of 2024, U.S. consumer behavior has continued to shift and evolve, as cost fatigue and labor markets restrict income growth and constrain consumer spending and purchasing patterns. As a result, consumer behavior related to our products has shifted. As such, during the six months ended June 30, 2024, we continued to experience a dynamic macroeconomic environment, including price volatility related to select commodities, resulting in corresponding incremental costs and gross margin pressures, and net sales and net income declines. Despite specific actions taken to mitigate these gross margin pressures, higher prices for direct materials used to manufacture our products were, and continue to be, the primary incremental cost to our business (see Consolidated Results of Operations included in this MD&A). We utilize many exchange traded commodities for our business that are subject to price volatility, specifically cocoa products, which experienced a market price increase of approximately 75% since the beginning of the year (see Part I, Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
Furthermore, certain geopolitical events, specifically the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have increased global economic and political uncertainty. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, this conflict did not have a material impact on our commodity prices or supply availability. However, we are continuing to monitor for any significant escalation or expansion of economic or supply chain disruptions or broader inflationary costs, which may result in material adverse effects on our results of operations.
As of June 30, 2024, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our key strategic initiatives and other material cash requirements in both the short-term and in the long-term; however, we continue to evaluate and take action, as necessary, to preserve adequate liquidity and ensure that our business can operate effectively during the current economic environment. We continue to monitor our discretionary spending across the organization (see Liquidity and Capital Resources included in this MD&A).
Based on the length and severity of the fluctuating macroeconomic environment, including price volatility for our commodities, the possibility of a recession, changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior, and changes in geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we may experience increasing supply chain costs, higher inflation and other impacts to our business. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of these potential and evolving impacts on our business, consolidated results of operations, segment results, liquidity and capital resources.

Results of Operations - Second Quarter 2024 vs. Second Quarter 2023


Net Sales 

Net sales were $2,074.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $2,490.3 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $415.8 million, or 16.7%. The net sales decrease was driven by a volume decline of approximately 18%, primarily due to a decrease in everyday core U.S. confection, primarily as a result of accelerated shipments in the first quarter of 2024 due to the anticipation of our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system implementation, which was completed in the beginning of the second quarter of 2024. Consolidated volume decline was partially offset by an increase in salty snack brands. The net sales decrease was partially offset by a favorable price realization of approximately 1%, driven by higher list prices primarily within our North America Confectionery and International segments, partially offset by unfavorable price realization in our North America Salty Snacks segment. Foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a favorable impact of less than 1%.

Key U.S. Marketplace Metrics

For the second quarter of 2024, our total U.S. retail takeaway declined 2.9% in the expanded multi-outlet combined plus convenience store channels (Circana MULO + C-Stores), which includes candy, mint, gum, salty snacks and grocery items. Our U.S. candy, mint and gum (“CMG”) consumer takeaway declined 5.0% and experienced a CMG market share decline of 138 basis points. Our Salty consumer takeaway increased 8.0% in the second quarter of 2024 and experienced a Salty market share increase of 22 basis points.
The CMG consumer takeaway and market share information reflects measured channels of distribution accounting for approximately 90% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily include food, drug, mass merchandisers, and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club and military channels. These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Circana, the Company’s market insights and analytics provider, and provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category.

Cost of sales were $1,240.7 million in the second quarter 2024 compared to $1,358.2 million in the same period 2023, a decrease of $117.5 million, or 8.6%. The decrease was driven by $224.0 million related to lower sales volume, in line with the declines in net sales noted above, and lower supply chain costs. The decrease was partially offset by $74.6 million in higher commodity costs, primarily driven by cocoa, an increase of $8.1 million of incremental business realignment costs, as well as unfavorable mix. The decrease was further offset by $31.9 million of unfavorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years’ commodity purchases (See Part I, Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information). 
Gross margin was 40.2% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 45.5% in the same period of 2023, a decrease of 530 basis points. The decrease was driven by unfavorable activity on our mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, unfavorable commodity costs, increased business realignment costs and unfavorable mix. The decrease was partially offset by the decline in net sales, as noted above, and lower supply chain costs.

SM&A Expenses 

SM&A expenses were $541.0 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $571.8 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $30.8 million, or 5.4%. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses decreased 15.4% driven primarily by a decrease in the North America Confectionery segment. SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, decreased 0.8% in the second quarter of 2024 driven by lower compensation costs across segments, partially offset by $24.1 million of incremental business realignment costs, as well as higher investments in capabilities and technology.

Business Realignment Activities

We periodically undertake business realignment activities designed to increase our efficiency and focus our business in support of our key growth strategies. Excluding the portion recorded within Cost of Sales and SM&A expenses (as noted above), we recorded $4.9 million business realignment costs during the second quarter of 2024, versus a benefit of $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. The costs in 2024 related to the Advancing Agility & Automation (“AAA”) Initiative, which commenced in 2024, focused on leveraging new technology to improve supply chain and manufacturing-related spend, and optimize selling, general and administrative expenses. The costs in 2023 related to the International Optimization Program, which completed in 2023. The International Optimization Program was focused on optimizing our China operating model to improve our operational efficiency and provide for a strong, sustainable and simplified base going forward. Costs associated with business realignment activities are classified in our Consolidated Statements of Income as described in Note 9 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Operating Profit and Operating Profit Margin 

Operating profit was $287.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $560.6 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $272.7 million, or 48.7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit and higher business realignment costs, partially offset by lower SM&A expenses, as noted above. Operating profit margin decreased to 13.9% in 2024 from 22.5% in 2023 driven by the same factors noted above that resulted in lower gross margin for the period.

Interest Expense, Net 

Net interest expense was $41.4 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $36.7 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of $4.7 million, or 12.9%. The increase was primarily due to higher rates on short-term debt balances in 2024 versus 2023, specifically related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings.

Other (Income) Expense, Net 

Other (income) expense, net was $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 versus net expense of $84.5 million in the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $83.9 million, or 99.3%. The decrease in net expense was primarily driven by $77.4 million of lower write-downs on equity investments qualifying for tax credits in 2024 versus the second quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $7.1 million of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 

The effective income tax rate was 26.4% for the second quarter of 2024 compared with 7.4% for the second quarter of 2023. Relative to the 21% statutory rate, the 2024 effective tax rate was primarily impacted by state taxes, tax reserves and unfavorable foreign rate differential, partially offset by the benefit of employee share-based payments. Relative to the 21% statutory rate, the 2023 effective tax rate was impacted by investment tax credits and employee share-based payments partially offset by state taxes and tax reserves.

Net Income and Earnings Per Share-diluted

Net income was $180.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $406.9 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $226.0 million, or 55.6%. EPS-diluted was $0.89 in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $1.98 in the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $1.09, or 55.1%. The decrease in both net income and EPS-diluted was driven by lower gross profit and higher income taxes, partially offset by lower SM&A expenses and lower other income and expenses. Our 2024 EPS-diluted benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding.

Results of Operations - First Six Months 2024 vs. First Six Months 2023


Net Sales 

Net sales were $5,327.2 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $5,477.9 million during the same period of 2023, a decrease of $150.7 million, or 2.8%. The net sales decrease was driven by a volume decrease of approximately 6%, primarily due to a decrease in everyday core U.S. confection and decreases across the International segment, partially offset by an increase in salty snack brands. The net sales decrease was partially offset by a favorable price realization of approximately 3%, primarily due to higher list prices across our reportable segments. Foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a favorable impact of less than 1%.

Key U.S. Marketplace Metrics

For the first six months of 2024, our total U.S. retail takeaway increased 0.5% in the expanded multi-outlet combined plus convenience store channels (IRI MULO + C-Stores), which includes candy, mint, gum, salty snacks and grocery items. Our U.S. CMG consumer takeaway declined 0.1% and experienced a CMG market share decline of 68 basis points. Our Salty consumer takeaway increased 3.2% and experienced a Salty market share increase of 5 basis points.

Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 

Cost of sales were $2,817.4 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $2,963.5 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $146.1 million, or 4.9%. The decrease was driven by an incremental $176.5 million of favorable mark-to-market activity on our commodity derivative instruments intended to economically hedge future years’ commodity purchases (See Part I, Item 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information). The decrease was further driven by $156.8 million related to lower sales volume. The decrease was partially offset by $187.2 million driven by higher commodity costs, higher supply chain costs, unfavorable mix and an increase of $9.7 million of incremental business realignment costs.
Gross margin was 47.1% in the first six months of 2024 compared to 45.9% in the same period of 2023, an increase of 120 basis points. The increase was driven by favorable year-over-year mark-to-market impact from commodity derivative instruments, favorable price realization and volume declines. The increase was partially offset by higher supply chain costs, including higher logistics and labor costs, unfavorable product mix and increased business realignment costs. 

SM&A Expenses

SM&A expenses were $1,159.0 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $1,153.4 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of $5.6 million, or 0.5%. Total advertising and related consumer marketing expenses decreased 1.1%, driven by a decrease in North America Confectionery, partially offset by an increase in North America Salty Snacks. SM&A expenses, excluding advertising and related consumer marketing, increased approximately 1.2% in the first six months of 2024 driven by an increase of $37.6 million of incremental business realignment costs, as well as higher investments in capabilities and technology.

Operating Profit and Operating Profit Margin 

Operating profit was $1,345.9 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $1,360.6 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $14.7 million, or 1.1%. The decrease was predominantly due to higher SM&A expenses, higher business realignment costs and lower gross profit, as noted above. Operating profit margin increased to 25.3% in the first six months of 2024 from 24.8% in the same period in 2023 driven by the same factors that resulted in higher gross margin for the period.

Interest Expense, Net 

Net interest expense was $81.2 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $74.3 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of $6.9 million, or 9.2%. The increase was primarily due to higher rates on short-term debt balances in 2024 versus 2023, specifically related to outstanding commercial paper borrowings. The increase was further driven by higher rates on long-term debt balances in 2024 versus 2023, due to the $350 million 4.25% and $400 million 4.50% Notes issued in May 2023. 

Other (Income) Expense, Net 

Other (income) expense, net was $32.6 million in the first six months of 2024 versus a net expense of $87.5 million in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of $54.9 million, or 62.7%. The decrease in net expense was primarily driven by $46.0 million of lower write-downs on equity investments qualifying for tax credits in 2024 versus the first six months of 2023 and a decrease of $9.6 million of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs relating to pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.

Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 

Our effective income tax rate was 20.6% for the first six months of 2024 compared with 17.1% for the first six months of 2023. Relative to the 21% statutory rate, the 2024 effective tax rate was impacted by investment tax credits partially offset by state taxes. Relative to the 21% statutory rate, the 2023 effective tax rate was impacted by investment tax credits and employee share-based payments partially offset by state taxes and tax reserves.

Net Income and Earnings Per Share-diluted

Net income was $978.3 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $994.2 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $15.9 million, or 1.6%. EPS-diluted was $4.80 in the first six months of 2024 compared to $4.83 in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $0.03, or 0.6%. The decrease in both net income and EPS-diluted was driven by lower gross profit, higher income taxes and higher SM&A, partially offset by lower other income and expenses. Our 2024 EPS-diluted benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our Board-approved repurchase programs.

SEGMENT RESULTS 

The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our three reportable segments: North America Confectionery, North America Salty Snacks and International. For segment reporting purposes, we use “segment income” to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Segment income excludes unallocated general corporate administrative expenses, unallocated mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivatives, business realignment and impairment charges, acquisition-related costs and other unusual gains or losses that are not part of our measurement of segment performance. These items of our operating income are largely managed centrally at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment income reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker and used for resource allocation and internal management reporting and performance evaluation. Segment income and segment income margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors, as they exclude the activities that are not directly attributable to our ongoing segment operations.
Our segment results, including a reconciliation to our consolidated results, were as follows:
|    |                                                                        |                    |         |                  |       |               |         |              |    |         |    |         |

(2)Net losses (gains) on mark-to-market valuation of commodity derivative positions recognized in unallocated derivative losses (gains). See Note 13 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.

North America Confectionery

The North America Confectionery segment is responsible for our chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery market position in the United States and Canada. This includes developing and growing our business in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery, gum and refreshment products, protein bars, spreads, snack bites and mixes, as well as pantry and food service lines. While a less significant component, this segment also includes our retail operations, including Hershey’s Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania; New York, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to third parties around the world.

Our International segment generated income of $67.8 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $96.2 million in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of $28.4 million, or 29.5%, driven primarily by volume declines, increased commodity costs and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable price realization and lower supply chain costs. 

Unallocated Corporate Expense

Unallocated corporate expense includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury, finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations, including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (d) acquisition and integration-related costs and (e) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance. 
In the second quarter of 2024, unallocated corporate expense totaled $161.5 million, as compared to $186.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $25.1 million, or 13.5%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower acquisition and integration related costs and lower compensation costs, partially offset by higher investments in capabilities and technology.
In the first six months of 2024, unallocated corporate expense totaled $334.4 million, as compared to $363.7 million in the first six months of 2023, a decrease of $29.3 million, or 8.1%. The decrease was primarily driven by lower acquisition and integration related costs, partially offset by incremental investments in capabilities and technology.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Historically, our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from operations. Domestic seasonal working capital needs, which typically peak during the summer months, are generally met by utilizing cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper. Commercial paper may also be issued, from time to time, to finance ongoing business transactions, such as the repayment of long-term debt, business acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes.
At June 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $467.1 million, an increase of $65.1 million compared to the 2023 year-end balance. Additional detail regarding the net uses of cash are outlined in the following discussion. Additionally, at June 30, 2024, we had outstanding short- and long-term debt totaling $5.4 billion, of which $605.2 million was classified as the current portion of long-term debt. Of the $605.2 million, $300 million of 2.050% Notes are due upon maturity on November 15, 2024 and $300 million of 0.900% Notes are due upon maturity on June 1, 2025. We believe we can satisfy these debt obligations with cash generated from our operations, issuing new debt, and/or by borrowing on our unsecured credit facility. 
Approximately 80% of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2024 was held by subsidiaries domiciled outside of the United States. A majority of this balance is distributable to the United States without material tax implications, such as withholding tax. We intend to continue to reinvest the remainder of the earnings outside of the United States for which there would be a material tax implication to distributing for the foreseeable future and, therefore, have not recognized additional tax expense on these earnings. We believe that our existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various short- and long-term cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures.

Operating activities
We generated cash of $894.7 million from operating activities in the first six months of 2024, a decrease of $155.1 million compared to $1,049.8 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was mainly driven by the following factors:
•Net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, a write-down of equity investments, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and other charges) resulted in $261.7 million of lower cash flow in 2024 relative to 2023.
•In the aggregate, select net working capital items, specifically, trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, consumed cash of $141.2 million in 2024, compared to $265.7 million in 2023. This $124.5 million fluctuation was mainly driven by a decrease in cash used by accounts receivable due to a decrease in sales of everyday core U.S. confection brands and lower inventory levels, partially offset by increase accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of vendor and supplier payments. 
•Timing of income tax payments contributed to an increase in operating cash of $63.6 million in 2024, compared to a decrease of $3.7 million in 2023. This $67.3 million fluctuation was primarily due to the variance in actual tax expense for 2024 relative to the timing of quarterly estimated tax payments. We paid cash of $165.5 million for income taxes during 2024 compared to $229.1 million in the same period of 2023.
Investing activities
We used cash of $389.7 million for investing activities in the first six months of 2024, a decrease of $126.3 million compared to $516.0 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was mainly driven by the following factors:
•Capital spending. Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, primarily to support our ERP system implementation, capacity expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $343.5 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to $330.5 million in the same period of 2023. Expenditures increased due to progress on capacity expansion projects and our ERP system implementation. We expect 2024 capital expenditures, including capitalized software, to approximate $600 million to $625 million, a slight decrease from our previously estimated range of $600 million to $650 million. The decrease in our 2024 capital expenditures is largely driven by the wind down of our key strategic initiatives, including completion of the upgrade of a new ERP system across the enterprise in 2024. We intend to use our existing cash and internally generated funds to meet our 2024 capital requirements.
•Investments in partnerships qualifying for tax credits. We make investments in partnership entities that in turn make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and renewable energy tax credits. We invested approximately $46.1 million in the first six months of 2024, compared to $19.1 million in the same period of 2023.
•Business Acquisition. In 2024, we had no acquisition activity. In May 2023, we acquired Weaver for a cash purchase price of $165.8 million. Further details regarding our business acquisition activity is provided in Note 2 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.
•Other investing activities. In the first six months of 2024 and 2023, our other investing activities were minimal.
Financing activities 
We used cash of $452.9 million for financing activities in the first six months of 2024, a decrease of $53.8 million compared to $506.7 million in the same period of 2023. This decrease in net cash used in financing activities was mainly driven by the following factors:
•Short-term borrowings, net. In addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. During the first six months of 2024, we generated cash of $610.0 million predominately through the issuance of short-term commercial paper, partially offset by a decrease in short-term foreign bank borrowings. During the

first six months of 2023, we generated cash of $166.0 million predominately through the issuance of short-term commercial paper, as well as an increase in short-term foreign bank borrowings. 
•Long-term debt borrowings and repayments. During the first six months of 2024, we had no long-term debt borrowings or repayments activity. During the first six months of 2023, we issued $350 million of 4.250% Notes due in May 2028 and $400 million of 4.500% Notes due in May 2033 (the “2023 Notes”). Proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, totaled $744,092. Additionally, in May 2023 we repaid $250 million of 2.625% Notes and $500 million of 3.375% Notes due upon their maturity 
•Dividend payments. Total dividend payments to holders of our Common Stock and Class B Common Stock were $543.9 million during the first six months of 2024, an increase of $130.4 million compared to $413.5 million in the same period of 2023. Details regarding our 2024 cash dividends paid to stockholders are as follows:

•Share repurchases. We repurchase shares of Common Stock to offset the dilutive impact of treasury shares issued under our equity compensation plans. The value of these share repurchases in a given period varies based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price. In addition, we periodically repurchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to Board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder value. Details regarding our share repurchases are as follows:

(2) In July 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase authorization to repurchase shares of our Common Stock. As a result of the February 2023 Stock Purchase Agreement with Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the School Trust, the July 2018 share repurchase authorization was completed. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization, which was completed as of March 31, 2024. In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. This program commenced after the existing May 2021 authorization was completed and is to be utilized at management’s discretion. As a result of the share repurchase authorization, approximately $470 million remains available for repurchases under our December 2023 share repurchase authorization. We are authorized to purchase our outstanding shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions. The program has no expiration date and acquired shares of Common Stock will be held as treasury shares. Purchases under approved share repurchase authorizations are in addition to our practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans.
•Proceeds from exercised stock options and employee tax withholding. During the first six months of 2024, we received $8.2 million from employee exercises of stock options and paid $30.0 million of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards. During the first six months of 2023, we received $22.0 million from employee exercises of stock options and paid $33.0 million of employee taxes withheld from share-based awards. Variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the share price at the date of grant.

Safe Harbor Statement

We are subject to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note the following factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions that we have discussed directly or implied in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Many of these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “strategy,” “target” and similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like “could,” “may,” “might,” “should,” “will” and “would,” among others. 
The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to the following:
•Our Company’s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results;
•Disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results;
•We might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global human capital we need to drive our growth strategies;
•Risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts, and increased focus and evolving views of our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders on climate change issues, could negatively affect our business and operations;

•Increases in raw material and energy costs, along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and our ability to successfully hedge against volatility in raw material pricing, could affect future financial results;
•Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity;
•Market demand for new and existing products could decline;
•Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business;
•Our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures;
•Our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations;
•We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business;
•Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products;
•Political, economic and/or financial market conditions, including impacts on our business arising from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could negatively impact our financial results;
•Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations;
•Complications with the design, implementation or usage of our new enterprise resource planning system, including the ability to support post-implementation efforts and maintain enhancements, new features or modifications, could adversely impact our business and operations; and

•Such other matters as discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Part II, Item 1A, ”Risk Factors.”

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in expectations or events or circumstances after the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed. 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


Interest Rate Risk

The total amount of short-term debt, net of cash, amounted to net debt of $854.2 million and net debt of $317.9 million, at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates applied to this variable-rate short-term debt as of June 30, 2024 would have changed interest expense by approximately $4.1 million for the first six months of 2024 and $3.1 million for 2023.
We consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates on our remaining debt portfolio, excluding fixed-rate debt converted to variable rates with fixed-to-floating instruments, to be minimal since this debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by approximately $169 million and $203 million, respectively. However, since we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments 

|    |                                                   |
|---:|:--------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | The Hershey Company | Q2 2024 Form 10-Q | Page 44 |

before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are exposed to currency fluctuations related to manufacturing or selling products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce fluctuations in our long or short currency positions relating primarily to purchase commitments or forecasted purchases for equipment, raw materials and finished goods denominated in foreign currencies.
The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts represents the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. The potential decline in fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of 10% was $11.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and $20.2 million as of December 31, 2023, generally offset by a reduction in foreign exchange associated with our transactional activities.

Commodities—Price Risk Management and Derivative Contracts

We use futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products, sugar, corn products, certain dairy products, wheat products, natural gas and diesel fuel primarily to mitigate price volatility and provide visibility to future costs within our supply chain. Significant changes impacting our commodity price risk management since our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K are described below.

Cocoa Products

During the first six months of 2024, the average cocoa futures contract price was $3.34 per pound, with a trading range of $1.84 to $5.20 per pound, based on the Intercontinental Exchange futures contract. This average cocoa futures contract price represents an increase of approximately 124% compared to the 2023 annual average of $1.49 per pound. The production forecast for the 2024 – 2025 season is improving in Ghana and Ivory Coast, due to a combination of favorable weather conditions and decreased demand for cocoa; however, the price outlook for cocoa remains uncertain due to significant liquidity and volatility issues, which may have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices (including amount and duration thereof), premiums and discounts reflective of varying delivery times, and supply and demand for our specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder. We generally hedge commodity price risks for 3- to 24-month periods. As a result, the average market prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs. 

Commodity Sensitivity Analysis

Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $92.3 million as of June 30, 2024 and $94.9 million as of December 31, 2023. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses by $1.4 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
For additional information about our market risks, see Item 7A under Part II of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    


Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

During the second quarter of 2024, we completed the process of our multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, which replaced our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance operational functionality, and provide timely information to the Company’s management team related to the operation of the business. During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the implementation of one operating segment that is included in our International segment. In July 2023, we completed the transition to our new consolidated financial reporting book of record. During October 2023, we completed the implementation of our new ERP system in the North America Salty Snacks segment. We completed the implementation of our new ERP system in the North America Confectionery segment and select operating segments included in our International segment in April 2024. The implementation of the new ERP system results in material changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. The Company has updated the internal controls as appropriate and will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation on our financial reporting business processes. Other than the ERP system implementation, there have been no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1. Legal Proceedings.


Information on legal proceedings is included in Note 15 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.


Item 1A. Risk Factors.

When evaluating an investment in our Common Stock, investors should consider carefully, among other things, the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "2023 Form 10-K"), Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024 (the “Q1 2024 Quarterly Report”), and the information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.


Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 


There were no purchases of our Common Stock made by or on behalf of Hershey, or any “affiliated purchaser” (as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of Hershey, during the three months ended June 30, 2024.

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, no shares of Common Stock were purchased in open market transactions in connection with our standing authorization to buy back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans, which authorization does not have a dollar or share limit and is not included in our share repurchase authorizations described in the following paragraph.
In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase authorization, which was completed as of March 31, 2024. In December 2023, our Board of Directors approved an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. This program commenced after the existing May 2021 authorization was completed and is to be utilized at management’s discretion. As a result of the share repurchase authorization, approximately $470 million remains available for repurchases under our December 2023 share repurchase authorization. We are authorized to purchase our outstanding shares in open market and privately negotiated transactions. The program has no expiration date and acquired shares of Common Stock will be held as treasury shares. Purchases under approved share repurchase authorizations are in addition to our practice of buying back shares sufficient to offset those issued under incentive compensation plans.

Item 5. Other Information.


Director and Executive Officer Trading

A portion of our directors’ and officers’ compensation is in the form of equity awards and, from time to time, they may engage in open-market transactions with respect to their Company securities for diversification or other personal reasons. All such transactions in Company securities by directors and officers must comply with the Company’s Insider Trading Policy, which requires that transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in the Company’s securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information. 
The following table describes the contracts, instructions or written plans for the purchase or sale of securities adopted by our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended June 30, 2024, that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c). No other Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or “non-Rule 10b5–1 trading arrangements” (as defined by S-K Item 408(c)) were entered into or terminated by our directors or officers during such period.
