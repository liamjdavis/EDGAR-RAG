This Amendment No. 1 to the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (this Amendment) amends and supplements the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 19, 2024 (as it may be further amended and supplemented from time to time, the Schedule TO) and relates to the offer by Rainier Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company, an Indiana corporation (Lilly), to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Shares), of Morphic Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Morphic), at a purchase price of $57.00 per Share, net to the stockholder in cash, without interest thereon and subject to any applicable tax withholding, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated July 19, 2024, and in the related Letter of Transmittal (which, together with the Offer to Purchase, as each may be amended or supplemented from time to time, collectively constitute the Offer), copies of which are attached to the Schedule TO as Exhibits (a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B), respectively. 

 The Offer will expire at one minute past 11:59 P.M., Eastern Time, on August 15, 2024, unless the Offer is extended or earlier terminated (such time or such subsequent time to which the expiration of the Offer is extended, the Expiration Time). In the case of an extension of the Expiration Time, a public announcement of such extension will be made no later than 9:00 A.M., Eastern Time, on the business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Time. The terms and conditions relating to the Offer, including the procedures regarding the extension of the Expiration Time, are described in Section 1  Terms of the Offer of the Offer to Purchase. 
 Except as otherwise set forth in this Amendment, the information set forth in the Schedule TO remains unchanged and is incorporated herein by reference to the extent relevant to the items in this Amendment. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Schedule TO. 
 
Items 1 through 9 and Item 11. 

 
The Offer to Purchase and Items 1 through 9 and Item 11 of the Schedule TO are hereby amended and supplemented by adding a new paragraph at the end of Section 15  Conditions of the Offer of the Offer to Purchase to read as follows: 

 The Regulatory Condition has been satisfied by the expiration of the HSR Act waiting period, effective July 31, 2024 at 11:59 P.M., Eastern Time. 
 
The Offer to Purchase and Items 1 through 9 and Item 11 of the Schedule TO are hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following sentence at the end of the second paragraph under the subheading Antitrust Compliance in Section 16  Certain Legal Matters; Regulatory Approvals of the Offer to Purchase: 

 The waiting period applicable to the Offer under the HSR Act expired on July 31, 2024 at 11:59 P.M., Eastern Time. Accordingly, the Regulatory Condition has been satisfied. The Offer continues to be subject to the remaining conditions set forth in this Offer to Purchase. See Section 15  Conditions of the Offer.
