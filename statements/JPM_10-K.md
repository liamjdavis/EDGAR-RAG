Supplemental Terms of the Notes

 The notes are not futures contracts or swaps and are not regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, as amended (the “Commodity Exchange Act”).  The notes are offered pursuant to an exemption from regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act, commonly known as the hybrid instrument exemption, that is available to securities that have one or more payments indexed to the value, level or rate of one or more commodities, as set out in section 2(f) of that statute. Accordingly, you are not afforded any protection provided by the Commodity Exchange Act or any regulation promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 For purposes of the accompanying product supplement, the Index will be deemed to be an Equity Index, except as provided below, and any references in the accompanying product supplement to the securities included in an Equity Index (or similar references) should be read to refer to the securities included in the S&P 500®
 Index, which is the reference index for the futures contracts included in the Index. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Index will be deemed to be a Commodity Index for purposes of the section entitled “The Underlyings — Indices — Discontinuation of an Index; Alteration of Method of Calculation” in the accompanying product supplement.

 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying product supplement, if a Determination Date (as defined in the accompanying product supplement) has been postponed to the applicable Final Disrupted Determination Date (as defined in the accompanying product supplement) and that day is a Disrupted Day (as defined in the accompanying product supplement), the calculation agent will determine the closing level of the Index for that Determination Date on that Final Disrupted Determination Date in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating the closing level of the Index last in effect prior to the commencement of the market disruption event (or prior to the non-trading day), using the official settlement price (or, if trading in the relevant futures contract has been materially suspended or materially limited, the calculation agent’s good faith estimate of the applicable settlement price that would have prevailed but for that suspension or limitation) at the close of the principal trading session on that date of each futures contract most recently composing the Index, as well as any futures contract required to roll any expiring futures contract in accordance with the method of calculating the Index.
 Any values of the Index, and any values derived therefrom, included in this pricing supplement may be corrected, in the event of manifest error or inconsistency, by amendment of this pricing supplement and the corresponding terms of the notes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the indenture governing the notes, that amendment will become effective without consent of the holders of the notes or any other party.

The following graph demonstrates the hypothetical payments at maturity on the notes for a range of Index Returns. There can be no assurance that the performance of the Index will result in the return of any of your principal amount.
 

How the Notes Work



Upside Scenario:

 If the Final Value is greater than the Initial Value, investors will receive at maturity the $1,000 principal amount plus a return equal to the Index Return times
 the Upside Leverage Factor of at least 1.85.

 |    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---:|:---|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | Assuming a hypothetical Upside Leverage Factor of 1.85, if the closing level of the Index increases 10.00%, investors will receive at maturity a return equal to 18.50%, or $1,185.00 per $1,000 principal amount note. |
 
Par Scenario:

 
If the Final Value is equal to the Initial Value or is less than the Initial Value but greater than or equal to the Barrier Amount of 70.00% of the Initial Value, investors will receive at maturity the principal amount of their notes.

 
Downside Scenario:

 If the Final Value is less than the Barrier Amount of 70.00% of the Initial Value, investors will lose 1% of the principal amount of their notes for every 1% that the Final Value is less than the Initial Value.
 |    |    |                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|---:|:---|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | For example, if the closing level of the Index declines 60.00%, investors will lose 60.00% of their principal amount and receive only $400.00 per $1,000 principal amount note at maturity. |
 The hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments on the notes shown above apply only if you hold the notes for their entire term. These hypotheticals do not reflect the fees or expenses that would be associated with any sale in the secondary market. If these fees and expenses were included, the hypothetical returns and hypothetical payments shown above would likely be lower.
 
Selected Risk Considerations

 An investment in the notes involves significant risks. These risks are explained in more detail in the “Risk Factors” sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement and product supplement and in Annex A to the accompanying prospectus addendum.
 
Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

|---:|:---|:----------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | YOUR INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES MAY RESULT IN A LOSS — |

 The notes do not guarantee any return of principal. If the Final Value is less than the Barrier Amount, you will lose 1% of the principal amount of your notes for every 1% that the Final Value is less than the Initial Value. Accordingly, under these circumstances, you will lose more than 30.00% of your principal amount at maturity and could lose all of your principal amount at maturity.

|---:|:---|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | CREDIT RISKS OF JPMORGAN FINANCIAL AND JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. — |

 Investors are dependent on our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s ability to pay all amounts due on the notes. Any actual or potential change in our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s creditworthiness or credit spreads, as determined by the market for taking that credit risk, is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes. If we and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to default on our payment obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the notes and you could lose your entire investment.

|---:|:---|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | AS A FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, JPMORGAN FINANCIAL HAS NO INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS AND HAS LIMITED ASSETS — |

 As a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co., we have no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of our securities and the collection of intercompany obligations. Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase & Co., substantially all of our assets relate to obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. to make payments under loans made by us to JPMorgan Chase & Co. or under other intercompany agreements. As a result, we are dependent upon payments from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to meet our obligations under the notes. We are not a key operating subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and in a bankruptcy or resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. we are not expected to have sufficient resources to meet our obligations in respect of the notes as they come due. If JPMorgan Chase & Co. does not make payments to us and we are unable to make payments on the notes, you may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase & Co., and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. For more information, see the accompanying prospectus addendum.

 The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Accordingly, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which JPMS is willing to buy the notes. You may not be able to sell your notes. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your notes to maturity.
 
|    |    |                                                                                         |

|---:|:---|:----------------------|
|  0 | ·  | POTENTIAL CONFLICTS — |

 We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the notes. In performing these duties, our and JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes. It is possible that hedging or trading activities of ours or our affiliates in connection with the notes could result in substantial returns for us or our affiliates while the value of the notes declines. Please refer to “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest” in the accompanying product supplement.

|---:|:---|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES WILL BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE (PRICE TO PUBLIC) OF THE NOTES — |

 The estimated value of the notes is only an estimate determined by reference to several factors. The original issue price of the notes will exceed the estimated value of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. See “The Estimated Value of the Notes” in this pricing supplement.

|---:|:---|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES IS DERIVED BY REFERENCE TO AN INTERNAL FUNDING RATE — |

 The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates’ view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. See “The Estimated Value of the Notes” in this pricing supplement.

|---:|:---|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | THE VALUE OF THE NOTES AS PUBLISHED BY JPMS (AND WHICH MAY BE REFLECTED ON CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS) MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES FOR A LIMITED TIME PERIOD — |

 We generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. See “Secondary Market Prices of the Notes” in this pricing supplement for additional information relating to this initial period. Accordingly, the estimated value of your notes during this initial period may be lower than the value of the notes as published by JPMS (and which may be shown on your customer account statements).
 
|    |    |                                                                                                        |
|---:|:---|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL LIKELY BE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE OF THE NOTES — |

 Any secondary market prices of the notes will likely be lower than the original issue price of the notes because, among other things, secondary market prices take into account our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances and, also, because secondary market prices may exclude selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and estimated hedging costs that are included in the original issue price of the notes. As a result, the price, if any, at which JPMS will be willing to buy the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if at all, is likely to be lower than the original issue price. Any sale by you prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.
 
|    |    |                                                                                             |
|---:|:---|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | SECONDARY MARKET PRICES OF THE NOTES WILL BE IMPACTED BY MANY ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS — |

 The secondary market price of the notes during their term will be impacted by a number of economic and market factors, which may either offset or magnify each other, aside from the selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, estimated hedging costs and the level of the Index. Additionally, independent pricing vendors and/or third party broker-dealers may publish a price for the notes, which may also be reflected on customer account statements. This price may be different (higher or lower) than the price of the notes, if any, at which JPMS may be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors” in the accompanying product supplement.

 The Index tracks the excess return of the Underlying Futures Contracts. The price of an Underlying Futures Contract depends not only on the level of the underlying index referenced by the Underlying Futures Contract, but also on a range of other factors, including but not limited to the performance and volatility of the U.S. stock market, corporate earnings reports, geopolitical events, governmental and regulatory policies and the policies of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the “Exchange”) on which the Underlying Futures Contracts trade. In addition, the futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including the lack of liquidity in the markets, the participation of speculators and government regulation and intervention. These factors and others can cause the prices of the Underlying Futures Contracts to be volatile and could adversely affect the level of the Index and any payments on, and the value of, your notes.

 Futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, the participation of speculators, and government regulation and intervention. In addition, futures exchanges generally have regulations that limit the amount of the Underlying Futures Contract price fluctuations that may occur in a single day. These limits are generally referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits” and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of those limits is referred to as a “limit price.” Once the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond the limit, or trading may be limited for a set period of time. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at potentially disadvantageous times or prices. These circumstances could delay the calculation of the level of the Index and could adversely affect the level of the Index and any payments on, and the value of, your notes.

|  0 | ·  | THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INDEX WILL DIFFER FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INDEX UNDERLYING THE UNDERLYING FUTURES CONTRACTS — |

 A variety of factors can lead to a disparity between the performance of a futures contract on an equity index and the performance of that equity index, including the expected dividend yields of the equity securities included in that equity index, an implicit financing cost associated with futures contracts and policies of the exchange on which the futures contracts are traded, such as margin requirements. Thus, a decline in expected dividends yields or an increase in margin requirements may adversely affect the performance of the Index. In addition, the implicit financing cost will negatively affect the performance of the Index, with a greater negative effect when market interest rates are higher. During periods of high market interest rates, the Index is likely to underperform the equity index underlying the Underlying Futures Contracts, perhaps significantly.

|  0 | ·  | NEGATIVE ROLL RETURNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNDERLYING FUTURES CONTRACTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LEVEL OF THE INDEX AND THE VALUE OF THE NOTES — |

 The Index tracks the excess return of the Underlying Futures Contracts. Unlike common equity securities, futures contracts, by their terms, have stated expirations. As the exchange-traded Underlying Futures Contracts approach expiration, they are replaced by contracts of the same series that have a later expiration. For example, an Underlying Futures Contract notionally purchased and held in June may specify a September expiration date. As time passes, the contract expiring in September is replaced by a contract for delivery in December. This is accomplished by notionally selling the September contract and notionally purchasing the December contract. This process is referred to as “rolling.” Excluding other considerations, if prices are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months, the notional purchase of the December contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price of the September contract, thereby creating a negative “roll return.” Negative roll returns adversely affect the returns of the Underlying Futures Contracts and, therefore, the level of the Index and any payments on, and the value of, the notes. Because of the potential effects of negative roll returns, it is possible for the level of the Index to decrease significantly over time, even when the levels of the underlying index referenced by the Underlying Futures Contracts are stable or increasing.

The Index


 The Index measures the performance of the nearest maturing quarterly Underlying Futures Contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the “Exchange”). The Underlying Futures Contracts are U.S. dollar-denominated futures contracts based on the S&P 500® Index. The S&P 500®
 Index consists of stocks of 500 companies selected to provide a performance benchmark for the U.S. equity markets. For additional information about the Index and the Underlying Futures Contracts, see Annex A in this pricing supplement.
 
Historical Information

 The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the Index based on the weekly historical closing levels of the Index from January 4, 2019 through July 26, 2024. The closing level of the Index on July 30, 2024 was 468.77. We obtained the closing levels above and below from the Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”), without independent verification.
 The historical closing levels of the Index should not be taken as an indication of future performance, and no assurance can be given as to the closing level of the Index on the Pricing Date or the Observation Date. There can be no assurance that the performance of the Index will result in the return of any of your principal amount.


Tax Treatment

 You should review carefully the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the accompanying product supplement no. 4-I. The following discussion, when read in combination with that section, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of notes.
 Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel it is reasonable to treat the notes as “open transactions” that are not debt instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as more fully described in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences — Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders — Notes Treated as Open Transactions That Are Not Debt Instruments” in the accompanying product supplement. Assuming this treatment is respected, the gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 Treasury and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Section 871(m) of the Code and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (“Section 871(m)”) generally impose a 30% withholding tax (unless an income tax treaty applies) on dividend equivalents paid or deemed paid to Non-U.S. Holders with respect to certain financial instruments linked to U.S. equities or indices that include U.S. equities. Section 871(m) provides certain exceptions to this withholding regime, including for instruments linked to certain broad-based indices that meet requirements set forth in the applicable Treasury regulations. Additionally, a recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a delta of one with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on certain determinations made by us, we expect that Section 871(m) will not apply to the notes with regard to Non-U.S. Holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the notes. You should consult your tax adviser regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the notes.
 
The Estimated Value of the Notes

 The estimated value of the notes set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement is equal to the sum of the values of the following hypothetical components: (1) a fixed-income debt component with the same maturity as the notes, valued using the internal funding rate described below, and (2) the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes. The estimated value of the notes does not represent a minimum price at which JPMS would be willing to buy your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the notes may differ from the market-implied funding rate for vanilla fixed income instruments of a similar maturity issued by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or its affiliates. Any difference may be based on, among other things, our and our affiliates’ view of the funding value of the notes as well as the higher issuance, operational and ongoing liability management costs of the notes in comparison to those costs for the conventional fixed income instruments of JPMorgan Chase & Co. This internal funding rate is based on certain market inputs and assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, and is intended to approximate the prevailing market replacement funding rate for the notes. The use of an internal funding rate and any potential changes to that rate may have an adverse effect on the terms of the notes and any secondary market prices of the notes. For additional information, see “Selected Risk Considerations — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Derived by Reference to an Internal Funding Rate” in this pricing supplement.
 The value of the derivative or derivatives underlying the economic terms of the notes is derived from internal pricing models of our affiliates. These models are dependent on inputs such as the traded market prices of comparable derivative instruments and on various other inputs, some of which are market-observable, and which can include volatility, dividend rates, interest rates and other factors, as well as assumptions about future market events and/or environments. Accordingly, the estimated value of the notes is determined when the terms of the notes are set based on market conditions and other relevant factors and assumptions existing at that time.
 The estimated value of the notes does not represent future values of the notes and may differ from others’ estimates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are greater than or less than the estimated value of the notes. In addition, market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change, and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect. On future dates, the value of the notes could change significantly based on, among other things, changes in market conditions, our or JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s creditworthiness, interest rate movements and other relevant factors, which may impact the price, if any, at which JPMS would be willing to buy notes from you in secondary market transactions.
 The estimated value of the notes will be lower than the original issue price of the notes because costs associated with selling, structuring and hedging the notes are included in the original issue price of the notes. These costs include the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, the projected profits, if any, that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes and the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes. Because hedging our obligations entails risk and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control, this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected, or it may result in a loss. A portion of the profits, if any, realized in hedging our obligations under the notes may be allowed to other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, and we or one or more of our affiliates will retain any remaining hedging profits. See “Selected Risk Considerations — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — The Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Lower Than the Original Issue Price (Price to Public) of the Notes” in this pricing supplement.

Secondary Market Prices of the Notes


For information about factors that will impact any secondary market prices of the notes, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — Secondary market prices of the notes will be impacted by many economic and market factors” in the accompanying product supplement. In addition, we generally expect that some of the costs included in the original issue price of the notes will be partially paid back to you in connection with any repurchases of your notes by JPMS in an amount that will decline to zero over an initial predetermined period. These costs can include selling commissions, projected hedging profits, if any, and, in some circumstances, estimated hedging costs and our internal secondary market funding rates for structured debt issuances. This initial predetermined time period is intended to be the shorter of six months and one-half of the stated term of the notes. The length of any such initial period reflects the structure of the notes, whether our affiliates expect to earn a profit in connection with our hedging activities, the estimated costs of hedging the notes and when these costs are incurred, as determined by our affiliates. See “Selected Risk Considerations — Risks Relating to the Estimated Value and Secondary Market Prices of the Notes — The Value of the Notes as Published by JPMS (and Which May Be Reflected on Customer Account Statements) May Be Higher Than the Then-Current Estimated Value of the Notes for a Limited Time Period” in this pricing supplement.
 
Supplemental Use of Proceeds

 The notes are offered to meet investor demand for products that reflect the risk-return profile and market exposure provided by the notes. See “Hypothetical Payout Profile” and “How the Notes Work” in this pricing supplement for an illustration of the risk-return profile of the notes and “The Index” in this pricing supplement for a description of the market exposure provided by the notes.
 The original issue price of the notes is equal to the estimated value of the notes plus the selling commissions paid to JPMS and other affiliated or unaffiliated dealers, plus (minus) the projected profits (losses) that our affiliates expect to realize for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the notes, plus the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes.
 
Additional Terms Specific to the Notes

 You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the time at which we accept such offer by notifying the applicable agent. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their issuance. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes, in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.
 You should read this pricing supplement together with the accompanying prospectus, as supplemented by the accompanying prospectus supplement relating to our Series A medium-term notes of which these notes are a part, the accompanying prospectus addendum and the more detailed information contained in the accompanying product supplement and the accompanying underlying supplement. This pricing supplement, together with the documents listed below, contains the terms of the notes and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms, correspondence, trade ideas, structures for implementation, sample structures, fact sheets, brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth in the “Risk Factors” sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement and the accompanying product supplement and in Annex A to the accompanying prospectus addendum, as the notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers before you invest in the notes.

Annex A


 The S&P 500® Futures Excess Return Index

 All information contained in this pricing supplement regarding the S&P 500® Futures Excess Return Index (the “SPX Futures Index”), including, without limitation, its make-up, method of calculation and changes in its components, has been derived from publicly available information, without independent verification. This information reflects the policies of, and is subject to change by, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (“S&P Dow Jones”). The SPX Futures Index is calculated, maintained and published by S&P Dow Jones. S&P Dow Jones has no obligation to continue to publish, and may discontinue the publication of, the SPX Futures Index.
 The SPX Futures Index is reported by Bloomberg L.P. under the ticker symbol “SPXFP.”
 The SPX Futures Index measures the performance of the nearest maturing quarterly E-mini® S&P 500® futures contracts (Symbol: ES) (the “Underlying Futures Contracts”) trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the “Exchange”). E-mini® S&P 500® futures contracts are U.S. dollar-denominated futures contracts based on the S&P 500® Index. For additional information about the S&P 500® Index, see “Equity Index Descriptions — The S&P U.S. Indices” in the accompanying underlying supplement. The SPX Futures Index is calculated real-time from the price change of the Underlying Futures Contracts. The SPX Futures Index is an “excess return” index that is based on price levels of the Underlying Futures Contracts as well as the discount or premium obtained by “rolling” hypothetical positions in the Underlying Futures Contracts as they approach delivery. The SPX Futures Index does not reflect interest earned on hypothetical, fully collateralized contract positions.
 
Index Rolling

 As each Underlying Futures Contract approaches maturity, it is replaced by the next maturing Underlying Futures Contract in a process referred to as “rolling.” The rolling of the SPX Futures Index occurs quarterly over a one-day rolling period (the “roll day”) every March, June, September and December, effective after the close of trading five business days preceding the last trading date of the maturing Underlying Futures Contract.
 On any scheduled roll day, the occurrence of either of the following circumstances will result in an adjustment of the roll day according to the procedure set forth in this section:
 |    |    |                                                        |
|---:|:---|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | An exchange holiday occurs on that scheduled roll day. |
 |    |    |                                                                                                                           |
|---:|:---|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0 | ·  | The daily contract price of any Underlying Futures Contract within the index on that scheduled roll day is a limit price. |
 If either of the above events occur, the relevant roll day will take place on the next designated commodity index business day whereby none of the circumstances identified take place.
 If a disruption is approaching the last trading day of a contract expiration, the Index Committee (defined below) will convene to determine the appropriate course of action, which may include guidance from the Exchange.
 The Index Committee may change the date of a given rebalancing for reasons including market holidays occurring on or around the scheduled rebalancing date. Any such change will be announced with proper advance notice where possible.
 
Index Calculations

 The closing level of the SPX Futures Index on any trading day reflects the change in the daily contract price of the Underlying Futures Contract since the immediately preceding trading day. On each quarterly roll day, the closing level of the SPX Futures Index reflects the change from the daily contract price of the maturing Underlying Futures Contract on the immediately preceding trading day to the daily contract price of the next maturing Underlying Futures Contract on that roll day.
 The daily contract price of an Underlying Futures Contract will be the settlement price reported by the Exchange. If the Exchange fails to open due to unforeseen circumstances, such as natural disasters, inclement weather, outages, or other events, the SPX Futures Index uses the prior daily contract prices. In situations where the Exchange is forced to close early due to unforeseen events, such as computer or electric power failures, weather conditions or other events, S&P Dow Jones calculates the closing level of the SPX Futures Index based on (1) the daily contract price published by the Exchange, or (2) if no daily contract price is available, the Index Committee determines the course of action and notifies clients accordingly.
 
Index Corrections and Recalculations

 S&P Dow Jones reserves the right to recalculate an index at its discretion in the event that settlement prices are amended or upon the occurrence of a missed index methodology event (deviation from what is stated in the methodology document).

Index Governance

 An S&P Dow Jones index committee (the “Index Committee”) maintains the SPX Futures Index. All committee members are full-time professional members of S&P Dow Jones’ staff. The Index Committee may revise index policy covering rules for including currencies, the timing of rebalancing or other matters. The Index Committee considers information about changes to the SPX Futures Index and related matters to be potentially market moving and material. Therefore, all Index Committee discussions are confidential.
 The Index Committees reserve the right to make exceptions when applying the methodology of the SPX Futures Index if the need arises. In any scenario where the treatment differs from the general rules stated in this document or supplemental documents, notice will be provided, whenever possible.
 In addition to the daily governance of the SPX Futures Index and maintenance of its index methodology, at least once within any 12-month period, the Index Committee reviews the methodology to ensure the SPX Futures Index continues to achieve the stated objectives, and that the data and methodology remain effective.

Background on Futures Contracts

 
Overview of Futures Markets 

 Futures contracts are contracts that legally obligate the holder to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined delivery price during a specified future time period. Futures contracts are traded on regulated futures exchanges, in the over-the-counter market and on various types of physical and electronic trading facilities and markets. An exchange-traded futures contract provides for the purchase and sale of a specified type and quantity of an underlying asset or financial instrument during a stated delivery month for a fixed price. A futures contract provides for a specified settlement month in which the cash settlement is made or in which the underlying asset or financial instrument is to be delivered by the seller (whose position is therefore described as “short”) and acquired by the purchaser (whose position is therefore described as “long”).

No purchase price is paid or received on the purchase or sale of a futures contract. Instead, an amount of cash or cash equivalents must be deposited with the broker as “initial margin.” This amount varies based on the requirements imposed by the exchange clearing houses, but it may be lower than 5% of the notional value of the contract. This margin deposit provides collateral for the obligations of the parties to the futures contract.
 By depositing margin, which may vary in form depending on the exchange, with the clearing house or broker involved, a market participant may be able to earn interest on its margin funds, thereby increasing the total return that it may realize from an investment in futures contracts.
 In the United States, futures contracts are traded on designated contract markets. At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, a trader may elect to close out its position by taking an opposite position on the exchange on which the trader obtained the position, subject to the availability of a liquid secondary market. This operates to terminate the position and fix the trader’s profit or loss. Futures contracts are cleared through the facilities of a centralized clearing house and a brokerage firm, referred to as a “futures commission merchant,” which is a member of the clearing house.
 Unlike common equity securities, futures contracts, by their terms, have stated expirations. At a specific point in time prior to expiration, trading in a futures contract for the current delivery month will cease. As a result, a market participant wishing to maintain its exposure to a futures contract on a particular asset or financial instrument with the nearest expiration must close out its position in the expiring contract and establish a new position in the contract for the next delivery month, a process referred to as “rolling.” For example, a market participant with a long position in a futures contract expiring in November who wishes to maintain a position in the nearest delivery month will, as the November contract nears expiration, sell the November contract, which serves to close out the existing long position, and buy a futures contract expiring in December. This will “roll” the November position into a December position, and, when the November contract expires, the market participant will still have a long position in the nearest delivery month.
 Futures exchanges and clearing houses in the United States are subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”). Exchanges may adopt rules and take other actions that affect trading, including imposing speculative position limits, maximum price fluctuations and trading halts and suspensions and requiring liquidation of contracts in certain circumstances. Futures markets outside the United States are generally subject to regulation by foreign regulatory authorities comparable to the CFTC. The structure and nature of trading on non-U.S. exchanges, however, may differ from the above description.
