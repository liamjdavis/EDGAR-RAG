Declaration of Dividend

 
On August 1, 2024, the Manager of the Company declared a daily distribution of $0.0000684932 per share (the “August 2024 Daily Distribution Amount”) (which equates to approximately 0.24% on an annualized basis calculated at the current rate, assuming a $10.49 per share purchase price) for shareholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the period commencing on August 1, 2024 and ending on August 31, 2024 (the “August 2024 Distribution Period”). The distributions will be payable to shareholders of record as of the close of business on each day of the August 2024 Distribution Period and the distributions are scheduled to be paid prior to October 21, 2024. While the Company’s Manager is under no obligation to do so, the annualized basis return assumes that the Manager will declare distributions in the future similar to the distributions disclosed herein.
